# Philadelphia — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Philadelphia's economic landscape presents a mixed picture, with both resilient and vulnerable aspects. The city's unemployment rate stands at 5.1%, slightly above the national average, placing it in the 14th percentile. This suggests a relatively weak labor market compared to other metropolitan areas. In contrast, the labor force participation rate of 63.89% is more in line with broader trends, indicating that a significant portion of the working-age population remains engaged in the labor market. Earnings growth is modest, with a year-over-year increase of just 1.01%, ranking in the 6th percentile. This may reflect subdued wage pressures or a shift towards lower-paying jobs.

The cost of living in Philadelphia is relatively low, with a Consumer Price Index of 7.56%, placing it in the 2nd percentile. This could provide some relief to residents. The housing market shows signs of strength, with a year-over-year increase in home prices of 14.33%, ranking in the 66th percentile. A relatively low number of days on the market (43 days) suggests robust demand for housing. However, the decline in building permits by 0.88% year-over-year, placing it in the 48th percentile, could indicate a slowdown in new construction, limiting future housing supply and potentially driving prices higher.

Business activity, as measured by weekly hours worked, is steady at 34.6 hours, ranking in the 66th percentile. This suggests that firms are maintaining their current levels of employment and production. Philadelphia's overall economic grade of "B-" with a weighted percentile of 42.1% reflects a below-average performance, highlighting the need for continued economic diversification and support.

To sustain and improve its economic trajectory, Philadelphia will need to address the challenges of a relatively high unemployment rate and modest earnings growth. It must also capitalize on its strong housing market and stable business activity. Policies aimed at fostering job creation, particularly in higher-wage sectors, and ensuring a balanced housing supply could help the city achieve a more balanced economic performance.

This growth, coupled with a relatively low number of days on the market (43 days), suggests a robust demand for housing. However, the decline in building permits by 0.88% year-over-year, placing it in the 48th percentile, could indicate a slowdown in new construction, which might limit future housing supply and potentially drive prices higher.
