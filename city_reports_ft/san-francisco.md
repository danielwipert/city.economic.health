# San Francisco — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Here's the edited version of the column:

San Francisco's economy is grappling with a mix of short-term difficulties and longer-term structural issues. The city's unemployment rate of 4.8% is marginally higher than the national average, suggesting a moderate pace of labour market recovery. Labour force participation stands at 64.89%, in line with broader trends, but this stability belies underlying challenges. Year-over-year earnings growth of 2.61% lags behind inflation, which is running at 6.73%, eroding purchasing power and potentially dampening consumer spending.

The city's housing market is experiencing a downturn, with home prices declining by 1.51% and per-square-foot prices falling by 4.22%. However, the median days on market of 42 days suggests that properties are still selling relatively quickly, indicating some underlying demand. Business activity is also showing signs of strain, with a significant 39.96% year-over-year decline in building permits, pointing to reduced investment in new construction and potential long-term implications for the city's growth and employment.

The city's labour market is also facing challenges, with weekly hours worked averaging 33.5 hours, below the national average. This could indicate underemployment or a shift towards part-time work. Despite these difficulties, San Francisco's tech sector remains a strong driver of the economy, though it is not immune to broader economic headwinds. The city's overall economic grade of "C" with a weighted percentile of 24% underscores the need for policy interventions to address these issues and stimulate broader economic recovery.

To navigate its economic challenges, San Francisco will need to strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation and managing the cost of living, particularly in housing. Addressing the decline in construction activity and supporting small businesses will be crucial. The city's resilience and the strength of its tech sector provide a foundation for recovery, but sustained efforts will be required to overcome the current economic hurdles.

San Francisco's economic landscape, as of the latest data, reflects a mix of short-term challenges and longer-term structural issues. The unemployment rate stands at 4.8%, slightly above the national average, indicating a moderate labor market recovery. The labor force participation rate of 64.89% is in line with broader trends, suggesting a stable but not robust labor market. Year-over-year earnings growth of 2.61% is modest, lagging behind inflation, which stands at 6.73%, eroding purchasing power and potentially dampening consumer spending. The city's housing market is experiencing a downturn, with a 1.51% decline in home prices and a 4.22% decrease in per-square-foot prices, reflecting a cooling market. However, the median days on market at 42 days suggests that while prices are falling, properties are still selling relatively quickly, indicating some underlying demand.

Business activity is also showing signs of strain, with a significant 39.96% year-over-year decline in building permits, pointing to reduced investment in new construction and potential long-term implications for the city's growth and employment. The weekly hours worked at 33.5 hours is below the national average, which could indicate underemployment or a shift towards part-time work. Despite these challenges, San Francisco's tech sector remains a strong driver of the economy, though it is not immune to broader economic headwinds. The city's overall economic grade of "C" with a weighted percentile of 24% underscores the need for policy interventions to address these issues and stimulate broader economic recovery.

Looking ahead, San Francisco will need to navigate the delicate balance between fostering innovation and managing the cost of living, particularly in housing. Addressing the decline in construction activity and supporting small businesses will be crucial. The city's resilience and the strength of its tech sector provide a foundation for recovery, but sustained efforts will be required to overcome the current economic hurdles.
