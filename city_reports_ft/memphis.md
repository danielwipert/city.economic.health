# Memphis — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Memphis, ranked 45th in the latest economic assessment, presents a complex economic landscape with both notable strengths and challenges. The city's unemployment rate of 4.6% is slightly above the national average, indicating a relatively tight labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.45% is low, suggesting that a significant portion of the population is not actively engaged in the workforce.

Memphis's economy is also characterised by robust earnings growth, with a year-over-year increase of 9.43%, outpacing many other metropolitan areas and reflecting strong wage pressures. The city's cost of living and wage growth are both favorable, with a cost of living index of 4.12 and a wage growth index of 2.76, placing Memphis in the 82nd and 60th percentiles, respectively. This combination suggests that the local economy is providing better-than-average real income gains for its residents.

The housing market, however, presents a more nuanced picture. Home prices have increased by 9.22% year-over-year, a healthy rate of growth but one that may be contributing to affordability concerns. The decline in building permits, down 34.38% year-over-year, is a short-term concern that could exacerbate housing supply issues. The average days on market for homes, at 68 days, is relatively high, suggesting a less dynamic market compared to other cities. Business activity, as measured by weekly hours worked (34.0 hours), is average, reflecting stable but not particularly dynamic business conditions.

Looking ahead, Memphis faces the challenge of balancing strong wage growth and a tight labor market with the need to improve labor force participation and address housing affordability. The city's strong earnings growth and favorable cost of living provide a solid foundation for continued economic development, but the decline in building permits and housing supply issues require attention to ensure the city's economic resilience is maintained.

The city's unemployment rate stands at 4.6%, slightly above the national average, indicating a relatively tight labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.45% is low, suggesting a significant portion of the population is not actively engaged in the workforce.

The cost of living and wage growth are both favorable, with the cost of living index at 4.12 and the wage growth index at 2.76, placing Memphis in the 82nd and 60th percentiles, respectively. This combination suggests that the local economy is providing better-than-average real income gains for its residents.

In the housing market, the picture is more nuanced. Home prices have increased by 9.22% year-over-year, which is a healthy rate of growth but may be contributing to affordability concerns. The number of building permits has declined sharply by 34.38% year-over-year, indicating a slowdown in new construction that could exacerbate housing supply issues. The average days on market for homes is 68 days, which is relatively high and suggests a less dynamic market compared to other cities. Business activity, as measured by the weekly hours worked (34.0 hours), is average, reflecting stable but not particularly dynamic business conditions.

Looking ahead, Memphis faces the challenge of balancing strong wage growth and a tight labor market with the need to improve labor force participation and address housing affordability. The decline in building permits is a short-term concern that could have longer-term implications for the housing market and overall economic resilience. However, the city's strong earnings growth and favorable cost of living provide a solid foundation for continued economic development.
