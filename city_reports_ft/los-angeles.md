# Los Angeles — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, the second-largest metropolitan area in the United States, presents a complex economic landscape. The unemployment rate of 5.9% is slightly above the national average, indicating a labour market that is recovering but still faces challenges. Labour force participation stands at 63.49%, a level below pre-pandemic highs that suggests some potential workers remain hesitant to re-enter the job market.

Earnings growth has been positive, at 4.16% year-over-year, outpacing inflation of 7.43%. However, the high cost of living threatens to erode real income gains for many residents. The housing market is also experiencing a cooling trend, with annual home price declines of 0.02% and a 2.11% decrease in single-family home sales. This slowdown may be attributed to higher interest rates and affordability issues. Notably, building permits have increased by 6.1% year-over-year, suggesting continued investment in new construction.

The average days on market for homes is 57, indicating a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a significant advantage. Business activity, as measured by weekly hours worked (33.7 hours), is stable but not robust, pointing to cautious employment practices by firms.

Looking ahead, Los Angeles faces the dual challenge of sustaining economic momentum while addressing structural issues such as high living costs and labour market participation. The resilience in earnings and construction activity provides a buffer against economic downturns, but policymakers will need to focus on strategies to improve long-term economic health and inclusivity.

Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, the second-largest metropolitan area in the United States, exhibits a mixed economic picture with both resilient and concerning indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 5.9%, slightly above the national average, reflecting a labor market that is recovering but still faces challenges. Labor force participation is at 63.49%, which, while below pre-pandemic levels, suggests some hesitancy among potential workers to re-enter the job market. Earnings growth has been positive at 4.16% year-over-year, outpacing inflation, which stands at 7.43%. However, the cost of living remains high, potentially eroding the real income gains for many residents.

In the housing market, the annual decline in home prices by 0.02% and a 2.11% decrease in single-family home sales indicate a cooling trend, possibly influenced by higher interest rates and affordability issues. Despite this, building permits have increased by 6.1% year-over-year, suggesting continued investment in new construction. The average days on market for homes is 57, indicating a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a significant advantage. Business activity, as measured by weekly hours worked (33.7 hours), is stable but not robust, pointing to cautious employment practices by firms.

Looking ahead, Los Angeles faces the dual challenge of maintaining economic momentum while addressing structural issues such as high living costs and labor market participation. The resilience in earnings and construction activity provides a buffer against economic downturns, but policymakers will need to focus on strategies to improve long-term economic health and inclusivity.
