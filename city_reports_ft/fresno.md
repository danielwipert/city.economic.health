# Fresno — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Fresno, the 48th-largest US metropolitan area, presents a complex economic landscape. The city's unemployment rate of 7.9% exceeds the national average, underscoring ongoing labour market challenges. Yet, a labour force participation rate of 60.66% suggests that a substantial proportion of the working-age population remains engaged in the job market.

Earnings growth of 4.59% year-over-year is slightly above the median for US metros, indicating some wage pressure and potential for improved living standards. However, the cost of living index of 5.44% and the owner-occupied housing rate of 12% are both below average, hinting at affordability issues and a relatively low homeownership rate.

The housing market is characterised by a robust annual increase in home prices of 9.84%, outpacing inflation and signalling strong demand. Despite a slight decline in single-family home sales (-0.76%), the median days on market of 59 days indicates a slower pace of sales, possibly due to affordability constraints. Building permits have surged by 61.97% year-over-year, pointing to significant investment in residential and commercial construction, which could bolster employment and economic growth in the medium term.

Fresno's overall economic grade of C+ and a weighted percentile score of 34.6% highlight that these positive developments are not yet translating into broad-based economic strength. To achieve more sustainable growth, the city's economy will need to address its high unemployment and low homeownership rates. Policymakers should focus on diversifying the local economy and enhancing workforce skills to improve long-term prospects, capitalising on the strong housing market and increased construction activity as a starting point.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Fresno, ranked 48th among US metropolitan areas, presents a mixed economic picture with notable strengths and weaknesses. The unemployment rate stands at 7.9%, significantly higher than the national average, reflecting ongoing challenges in the labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.66% suggests that a relatively high proportion of the working-age population remains engaged in the job market. Earnings growth is positive at 4.59% year-over-year, which is slightly above the median for US metros, indicating some wage pressure and potential for improved living standards. The cost of living index at 5.44% and the owner-occupied housing rate at 12% are both below average, suggesting affordability issues and a relatively low homeownership rate.

In the housing market, the annual increase in home prices of 9.84% is robust, outpacing inflation and signaling strong demand despite a slight decline in single-family home sales (-0.76%). The median days on market at 59 days is relatively high, indicating a slower pace of sales, possibly due to affordability constraints. Business activity, as measured by building permits, has surged by 61.97% year-over-year, pointing to significant investment in residential and commercial construction, which could bolster employment and economic growth in the medium term. However, the city's overall economic grade of C+ and a weighted percentile score of 34.6% highlight that these positive developments are not yet translating into broad-based economic strength.

Looking ahead, Fresno's economy will need to address its high unemployment and low homeownership rates to achieve more sustainable growth. The strong housing market and increased construction activity are positive signs, but policymakers should focus on diversifying the local economy and enhancing workforce skills to improve long-term prospects.
