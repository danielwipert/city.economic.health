# Oklahoma City — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Here's the revised column:

Oklahoma City's economy is marked by a strong short-term performance and a stable long-term foundation. The city's unemployment rate of 3.3% places it in the 92nd percentile among metropolitan areas, underscoring a tight labor market. Labour force participation stands at 66.29%, a solid figure that nonetheless leaves room for improvement, ranking in the 72nd percentile. Earnings growth of 6.15% year-over-year reflects healthy wage increases that could support consumer spending. However, moderate inflationary pressures are evident in the 4.68% cost of living index and a 2.32% over-the-week rate, which may erode purchasing power if wages do not keep pace.

The housing market in Oklahoma City is experiencing significant appreciation, with home prices rising 15.01% year-over-year, ranking in the 68th percentile. The relatively low 56 days on market and strong buyer interest suggest a competitive market. Meanwhile, construction activity remains positive, with building permits up 10.49% year-over-year, albeit slightly below the median, indicating a cautious approach to new development. Business activity, as measured by weekly hours worked, is robust at 35.4 hours, placing the city in the 90th percentile, and suggesting strong demand for labor and potentially high productivity levels.

Looking ahead, Oklahoma City's economy appears well-positioned to sustain its growth trajectory, driven by a strong labor market and a resilient housing sector. However, the city will need to manage inflationary pressures and ensure that wage growth keeps pace with rising costs to maintain consumer confidence and economic stability. The ongoing strength in construction and business activity also bodes well for sustaining economic momentum in the medium term.
