# Indianapolis — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Here's the edited version of the column:

The Indianapolis-Carmel-Greenwood metropolitan area boasts a resilient labor market, with an unemployment rate of 3.6% placing it in the 84th percentile nationally. The labor force participation rate stands at 67.95%, a strong indicator of the working-age population's engagement in the economy. Earnings growth has been particularly notable, with a year-over-year increase of 7.15%, underscoring the region's economic health. However, the average weekly hours worked is relatively low at 33.4 hours, which may suggest a tight labor market where employers struggle to fill full-time positions or a preference for part-time work among the local workforce.

The housing sector has seen significant appreciation, with home prices increasing by 16.15% year-over-year, outpacing many other markets. While this growth is positive for homeowners, it poses affordability challenges for first-time buyers. The number of building permits issued has grown by 5.24% year-over-year, indicating continued investment in residential construction. However, the 50-day days on market metric suggests some cooling in the pace of sales or a mismatch between buyer demand and available inventory.

Looking ahead, Indianapolis appears to be navigating a period of solid economic expansion, driven by a strong labor market and healthy earnings growth. The housing market remains vibrant but faces potential headwinds related to affordability and supply constraints. Continued monitoring of these indicators will be crucial to assess the sustainability of the current growth trajectory and identify any emerging risks.
