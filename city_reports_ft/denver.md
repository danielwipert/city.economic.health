# Denver — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Here's the edited version of the column:

Denver's economy presents a mixed picture, with robust labour market fundamentals offset by a cooling in the housing sector. The city's unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, placing it in the 76th percentile nationally, indicating a strong job market. Labour force participation is notably high at 71.28%, ranking in the 92nd percentile, suggesting a high level of engagement among the working-age population. Earnings growth year-over-year is solid at 6.09%, though this is slightly below the national average, placing it in the 74th percentile.

The cost of living increase of 4.69% is moderate, in line with broader inflationary pressures seen across the US. In contrast, the housing market is showing signs of softening. While building permits have increased by 13.55% year-over-year, reflecting continued interest in new construction, home prices have declined by 0.72% over the same period. This suggests a potential adjustment to more sustainable levels after years of rapid appreciation. The days on market metric has risen to 63 days, up from lower levels in recent years, which could indicate a slowdown in sales velocity.

Business activity, as measured by weekly hours worked, remains stable at 33.8 hours, but this figure is in the lower 34th percentile, hinting at cautious employment practices or structural changes in work patterns. Looking ahead, Denver's strong labour market and high labour force participation will likely continue to support consumer spending and economic resilience. However, the cooling in the housing market may temper overall economic growth, particularly if it leads to reduced investment in real estate and related sectors. Policymakers and businesses will need to monitor these trends closely, especially as they navigate the broader economic uncertainties affecting the US and global economies.

Denver's economy presents a mixed picture, with strong labor market fundamentals but some cooling in the housing sector. The unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, placing it in the 76th percentile nationally, indicating a robust job market. The labor force participation rate is notably high at 71.28%, ranking in the 92nd percentile, suggesting a high level of engagement among the working-age population. Earnings growth year-over-year is solid at 6.09%, though this is slightly below the national average as reflected by its 74th percentile score. The cost of living increase of 4.69% is moderate, aligning with broader inflationary pressures seen across the U.S.

In the housing market, while building permits have increased by 13.55% year-over-year, reflecting continued interest in new construction, home prices have shown a slight decline of 0.72% over the same period. This suggests a potential softening in demand or an adjustment to more sustainable levels after years of rapid appreciation. The days on market metric has risen to 63 days, up from lower levels in recent years, which could indicate a slowdown in sales velocity. Business activity, as measured by weekly hours worked, remains stable at 33.8 hours, but this figure is in the lower 34th percentile, hinting at cautious employment practices or structural changes in work patterns.

Policymakers and businesses will need to monitor these trends closely, especially as they navigate the broader economic uncertainties affecting the U.S. and global economies.
