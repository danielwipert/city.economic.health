# Virginia Beach — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Virginia Beach, part of the Virginia Beach-Chesapeake-Norfolk metropolitan area, presents a mixed economic picture. The city's unemployment rate of 4.0% is marginally above the national average, yet still suggests a relatively stable labour market. Conversely, a low labour force participation rate of 59.97% indicates that a substantial portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labour market.

On a more positive note, earnings growth has been robust, with a year-over-year increase of 8.75%, placing Virginia Beach in the 92nd percentile for this metric. This strong earnings growth is driving consumer spending and overall economic activity.

The housing market in Virginia Beach is experiencing a period of strong appreciation, with home prices rising by 18.59% year-over-year, placing the city in the 86th percentile for housing price growth. While this rapid appreciation benefits homeowners, it may pose affordability challenges for first-time buyers and renters. The number of building permits issued has increased by 5.26% year-over-year, indicating continued investment in new housing and commercial developments. The average days on market for homes, at 44 days, is down from historical averages, suggesting that the market is not overheating. The office vacancy rate of 1.94% is relatively low, indicating a tight market for commercial real estate, which could be a positive sign for business activity.

Looking ahead, Virginia Beach's economy appears to be on a stable trajectory, supported by strong earnings growth and a resilient housing market. However, the low labour force participation rate and potential housing affordability issues are areas that warrant attention. Addressing these challenges could help sustain the city's economic momentum and ensure broader participation in its growth.
