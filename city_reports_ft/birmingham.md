# Birmingham — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Birmingham, the UK's second-largest city, presents a complex economic landscape, with some indicators pointing to robust performance and others highlighting areas of concern. The labour market is a notable example: with an unemployment rate of 2.5%, Birmingham ranks in the 98th percentile nationally, indicating a tight job market. However, the labour force participation rate of 60.1% is relatively low, placing it in the 8th percentile, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population remains outside the labour market.

Earnings growth is moderate, at 2.45% year-over-year, while the cost of living has increased by 4.97%. The average weekly hours worked (35.3) are above the national average, indicating strong demand for labour. This is a positive sign for the local economy, but also raises concerns about affordability.

In the housing market, Birmingham has seen a significant 15.41% year-over-year increase in house prices, which may pose affordability challenges for first-time buyers. The number of building permits has increased by 1.56% year-over-year, suggesting continued investment in new housing and commercial developments. However, the average days on market for properties (60 days) is relatively high, indicating some softness in the market, possibly due to affordability issues or a mismatch between buyer preferences and available inventory.

Business activity, as measured by the number of new business formations, is stable, with a modest but steady growth in the local economy. To sustain this growth, policymakers will need to focus on inclusive strategies to address the low labour force participation rate and maintain housing affordability. Birmingham's strong labour market and ongoing investment in infrastructure and development projects are positive factors, but policymakers must ensure that the benefits of economic expansion are widely shared.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Birmingham, the UK's second-largest city, presents a mixed economic picture, with some indicators pointing to robust performance while others highlight areas of concern. The labour market is a case in point: the city boasts a low unemployment rate of 2.5%, placing it in the 98th percentile nationally, which is a strong signal of a tight job market. However, the labour force participation rate of 60.1% is relatively low, ranking in the 8th percentile, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population remains outside the labour market. Earnings growth is moderate, at 2.45% year-over-year, and the cost of living, while not exceptionally high, is still a concern with a 4.97% increase. The average weekly hours worked (35.3) is above the national average, indicating strong demand for labour.

In the housing market, Birmingham has seen a robust 15.41% year-over-year increase in house prices, which is a positive sign for property owners but may pose affordability challenges for first-time buyers. The number of building permits has increased by 1.56% year-over-year, suggesting continued investment in new housing and commercial developments. However, the average days on market for properties (60 days) is relatively high, indicating some softness in the market, possibly due to affordability issues or a mismatch between buyer preferences and available inventory. Business activity, as measured by the number of new business formations, is stable, with a year-over-year change in permits suggesting a modest but steady growth in the local economy.

Looking ahead, Birmingham's economic trajectory will likely be influenced by its ability to address the low labour force participation rate and maintain housing affordability. The city's strong labour market and ongoing investment in infrastructure and development projects are positive factors, but policymakers will need to focus on inclusive growth strategies to ensure that the benefits of economic expansion are widely shared.
