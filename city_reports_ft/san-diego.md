# San Diego — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

San Diego's economy faces a complex mix of challenges and opportunities that will shape its long-term trajectory. The city's unemployment rate stands at 5.0%, marginally above the national average, indicating moderate job market stress. Labour force participation, at 62.1%, suggests a less engaged workforce compared to more robust economies.

Earnings growth has been modest, at 2.04% year-over-year, lagging behind inflation rates and eroding purchasing power and consumer confidence. The cost of living index, at 7.29, reflects higher living costs that can deter both residents and businesses from settling in the area.

The housing market is showing signs of a cooling trend, with a 0.67% year-over-year decline in home prices and a 3.13% decrease in price per square foot. This shift could indicate a change in buyer sentiment or an oversupply of properties. However, the surge in building permits, up 61.67% year-over-year, suggests continued investment in new construction and potential future growth in the housing sector. The average time to sell a home, 47 days, indicates a notable slowdown in transactional activity that may dampen investor enthusiasm.

The business environment in San Diego is mixed, with strong indicators in new construction but weaker performance in earnings growth and employment metrics. The city's overall economic grade of "C" with a weighted percentile of 24.2% underscores the need for diversified economic strategies to enhance resilience. To address these challenges, the focus should be on improving earnings growth to support consumer spending and addressing the cost of living in the short term. In the longer term, fostering innovation and attracting high-value industries could help stabilize and grow the local economy.
