# Charlotte — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Here's the revised column:

Charlotte, the 21st-ranked US metro, presents a mixed economic picture. While its labor market remains a strength, with an unemployment rate of 4.1% (92nd percentile) and a labor force participation rate of 64.69% (average), earnings growth has slowed to 1.59% year-over-year, placing it in the 16th percentile. This divergence between stable employment and lagging wage growth could impact consumer spending and overall economic dynamism.

The housing market is also showing signs of strain. Charlotte's home price index has grown by 1.59% year-over-year, a moderate pace, but building permits have declined by 15.37% year-over-year, suggesting a slowdown in new construction. This could be a response to cooling demand or rising costs. The median days on market for homes, at 59 days, is relatively high, indicating a softening in the housing market. Business activity, as measured by weekly hours worked, is also low, at 33.2 hours (6th percentile), suggesting a cautious approach to labor utilization.

Looking ahead, Charlotte's economy faces a key challenge: balancing stable employment with the need for stronger wage growth and a more vibrant housing market. The decline in construction permits and the increase in days on market for homes suggest that the housing sector may be adjusting to changing market conditions. Policymakers and businesses will need to closely monitor these trends to ensure the city's economic resilience is maintained.
