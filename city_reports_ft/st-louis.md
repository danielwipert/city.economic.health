# St. Louis — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

St. Louis, the 23rd-ranked major U.S. metropolitan area, presents a mixed economic picture. The city's unemployment rate of 4.5% is slightly above the national average, while its labor force participation rate of 65.69% is robust, placing it in the 68th percentile among peers. However, earnings growth is modest, with a year-over-year increase of 1.2%, ranking in the 8th percentile.

The city's cost of living is relatively low, at 68% of the national average, which could be a significant draw for businesses and residents. Housing market indicators are mixed: the housing price index has risen by 17.21% year-over-year, reflecting strong demand, but the number of building permits has declined by 15.43% over the same period, suggesting a potential supply constraint. The average days on market for homes is 45 days, indicating a balanced market, while the year-over-year change in the price per square foot has increased by just 0.81%, a relatively flat trend.

Business activity in St. Louis is characterized by moderate weekly hours worked (33.8 hours), placing it in the 34th percentile, and a relatively low wage-to-rent ratio of 1.28, in the 12th percentile, which may impact the attractiveness of the area for higher-income professionals. The city's overall economic health is rated as average, with a weighted percentile score of 52.8 and a grade of B. The low cost of living and strong labor force participation are significant strengths, but the city will need to address the slow earnings growth and potential housing supply issues to sustain its economic momentum.

To achieve sustained growth, St. Louis will need to focus on strategies to boost earnings and productivity while ensuring that the housing market remains accessible and responsive to demand. Addressing these issues could help the city attract more businesses and talent, further solidifying its economic position.
