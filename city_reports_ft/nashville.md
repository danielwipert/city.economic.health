# Nashville — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Here's the revised column:

Nashville's economy is a microcosm of the US economy's dual trends: robust fundamentals and emerging challenges. The city's labor market stands out, boasting an unemployment rate of 3.1%, placing it in the 94th percentile among major metropolitan areas. This is underpinned by a high labor force participation rate of 75.77%, in the 98th percentile, indicating strong workforce engagement. However, earnings growth has been modest, at 2.8% year-over-year, lagging the national average and placing the city in the 34th percentile.

The cost of living, while manageable, has risen by 5.68% year-over-year, placing Nashville in the 14th percentile. This could put pressure on household budgets, particularly for lower-income residents. The city's housing market remains a significant driver of economic activity, with prices increasing by 10.55% year-over-year, placing it in the 56th percentile. New construction is also thriving, with building permits up by 22.78% year-over-year, in the 84th percentile. Yet, the market is showing signs of cooling, with properties taking an average of 61 days to sell, in the 22nd percentile, suggesting a potential slowdown in demand.

Business activity, as measured by weekly hours worked, remains robust at 35 hours, in the 82nd percentile, indicating sustained operational levels across various sectors. Looking ahead, Nashville's economy appears well-positioned to continue its growth trajectory, supported by a strong labor market and ongoing housing development. However, the city will need to address the rising cost of living and potential housing market slowdown to maintain its economic momentum. Modest earnings growth and increasing cost pressures could pose challenges for consumer spending and overall economic resilience.
