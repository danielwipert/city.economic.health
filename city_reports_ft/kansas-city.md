# Kansas City — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Kansas City's economic landscape presents a nuanced picture, with both encouraging and cautionary signs. The city's unemployment rate of 4.3% places it in the 48th percentile among major metropolitan areas, slightly above the national average. Conversely, its labour force participation rate of 68.55% is notably high, ranking in the 86th percentile, indicating a strong engagement of the working-age population in the labour market. Earnings growth has been moderate, with a year-over-year increase of 3.67%, in line with broader economic trends. The cost of living, measured by the Consumer Price Index, has risen by 4.98% year-over-year, reflecting broader inflationary pressures.

In the housing market, Kansas City has experienced a significant increase in home prices, with a year-over-year growth of 16.91%, placing it in the 80th percentile. This strong appreciation is supported by a healthy pace of new housing permits, up 10.29% year-over-year, and a relatively low number of days on market at 51 days, suggesting a balanced market with steady demand. Business activity, as measured by the number of permits for new construction, also shows a positive trend. However, the city's labour market exhibits some softness, with weekly hours worked averaging 33.4 hours and an overall wage replacement rate of 1.04, both lower than the national average.

Looking ahead, Kansas City's economy appears to be on a stable trajectory, underpinned by strong labour force participation and a robust housing market. Nevertheless, the city's moderate earnings growth and rising cost of living pose challenges that must be addressed. To sustain its economic momentum, Kansas City will need to focus on fostering higher wage growth and maintaining affordable living conditions.
