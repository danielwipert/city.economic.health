## Polished FT-style column

Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler, the 10th largest metropolitan area in the US, presents a complex economic landscape. The labour market remains relatively resilient, with an unemployment rate of 4.2%, marginally above the national average. Labour force participation stands at 65.47%, exceeding the national median, indicating a high level of engagement among the working-age population. Earnings growth has been robust at 5.17% year-over-year, outpacing inflation and boding well for consumer spending and economic resilience. However, the cost of living has risen by 5.08% year-over-year, potentially offsetting real income gains for many residents.

The local housing market, a crucial sector, is showing signs of slowing. Home prices have declined by 1.68% year-over-year, while new housing permits have dropped by 21.38%, reflecting a slowdown in construction activity. The decline in permits is particularly noteworthy, as it suggests a reduction in future housing supply, which could impact the real estate market and related industries. The median days on market for homes has increased to 58 days, indicating a softer demand environment.

Despite these challenges, Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler's overall economic grade remains a B-, placing it in the below-average category. While the city faces headwinds, it remains a resilient and dynamic market. To maintain its economic momentum, Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler will need to address the cooling housing market and rising cost of living. The strong labour market and positive earnings growth provide a solid foundation, but policymakers and businesses must closely monitor these trends to ensure sustainable growth.
