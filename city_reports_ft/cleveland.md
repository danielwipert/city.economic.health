# Cleveland — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Cleveland's economic landscape presents a complex mix of resilience and ongoing challenges. The city's unemployment rate of 3.4% places it in the 90th percentile nationally, indicating a robust labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 58.01% ranks in the 2nd percentile, suggesting structural issues such as an aging population or skill mismatches may be hindering the city's economic potential.

Earnings growth in Cleveland is modest at 1.36% year-over-year, placing the city in the 10th percentile. This slower recovery in wage growth contrasts with other metropolitan areas. In contrast, the city's housing market shows strength, with a 4.67% year-over-year increase in home prices and a 12.86% rise in the price per square foot, both outpacing national averages. The median days on market for homes is 55 days, indicating a balanced market.

Business activity in Cleveland is also improving, with building permits up 14.96% year-over-year, a positive signal for future economic growth and investment. However, the city's overall economic performance, as measured by a weighted percentile score of 53.7, suggests an average standing, with room for improvement in several key areas. The labor market, while strong in terms of unemployment, needs to address low participation rates to fully capitalize on economic opportunities.

To solidify its economic position and foster long-term prosperity, Cleveland must enhance labor force participation and accelerate wage growth. The housing market's strength is a positive factor, but it is crucial to ensure this growth is sustainable and inclusive. Addressing these challenges will be key to unlocking Cleveland's full economic potential.
