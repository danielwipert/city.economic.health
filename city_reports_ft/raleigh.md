# Raleigh — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Raleigh-Cary's economy presents a nuanced picture, with a strong labour market underpinned by robust fundamentals. The unemployment rate stands at 3.5%, significantly below the national average, while the labour force participation rate remains healthy at 67.45%. Earnings growth has been solid, rising 6.01% year-over-year, outpacing inflation, which currently stands at 4.77%. However, a decline in weekly hours worked to 33.4 hours suggests a moderation in work intensity that may be influenced by seasonal factors or industry-specific changes.

The housing market, while still showing resilience, is experiencing a slowdown. Home prices have increased by 10.75% year-over-year, but building permits have fallen by 28.25%, indicating a potential decline in new construction. This decline in permits, combined with a 0.9% year-over-year decrease in sales pace and an increase in days on market to 60, suggests that the rapid appreciation in home values may be moderating. Business activity remains stable, with the overall economic grade for Raleigh-Cary at B, reflecting average performance across key indicators.

Raleigh-Cary's diversified economy, anchored by technology, education, and healthcare sectors, positions it well to navigate potential economic headwinds. However, continued monitoring of the housing market and labour dynamics will be crucial, as these sectors can significantly influence broader economic outcomes.
