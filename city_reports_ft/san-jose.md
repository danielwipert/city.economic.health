# San Jose — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, a major hub of the technology industry, presents a complex economic landscape. While boasting notable strengths, the region is also facing emerging challenges. The unemployment rate stands at 4.7%, marginally above the national average, reflecting a labor market that is robust but not without its pressures. Labour force participation remains solid at 64.77%, indicating a relatively engaged workforce. However, earnings have contracted by 0.88% year-over-year, which could signal a slowdown in wage growth or a shift in employment patterns within the tech sector.

The cost of living in San Jose remains a significant burden, with prices 7.66% above the national average. This could exacerbate income inequality and affect consumer spending. In contrast, housing and business activity paint a more optimistic picture. Housing prices have increased by 6.95% year-over-year, driven by strong demand despite a slight decline in permits issued. Permits are up 90.23% compared to the previous year, suggesting a tight supply in the housing market. Business activity, as measured by the number of new establishments, has shown resilience, with a cautious approach to hiring indicated by a relatively low pace of job openings (2.14% of the workforce). The average days on market for homes is 38 days, further underscoring the strong demand in the real estate sector.

San Jose's economy will likely continue to navigate the tension between high living costs and robust tech-driven growth. Attracting and retaining talent will be crucial, particularly if wage growth does not keep pace with rising expenses. Policymakers and businesses must address these challenges to ensure sustainable economic development and maintain the region's competitive edge.
