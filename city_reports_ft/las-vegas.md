# Las Vegas — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Las Vegas, a city renowned for its vibrant entertainment sector, is navigating a complex economic landscape with mixed signals. The unemployment rate stands at 5.6%, slightly above the national average, reflecting the lingering impact of pandemic-induced disruptions on the local labor market. Labour force participation is 63.62%, placing Las Vegas in the 36th percentile nationally, indicating a moderate level of workforce engagement. In contrast, earnings growth is robust, up 6.47% year-over-year, significantly outpacing the national average and placing the city in the 80th percentile. This strong wage growth is largely driven by the recovery in tourism and hospitality, key drivers of the local economy.

The housing market presents a more nuanced picture. Home prices have increased by only 0.24% year-over-year, a stark contrast to the double-digit gains seen in many other U.S. markets. This modest growth, coupled with a 46.49% decline in permits for new construction, suggests a cooling market and potential oversupply issues. The median days on market for homes is 57, a relatively high figure indicating a slowdown in sales activity. Business activity, as measured by weekly hours worked (34.2 hours), is average, but the cost of living index (5.22) and the owner-occupied housing rate (3.04) suggest that living costs remain manageable compared to other major metropolitan areas.

Looking ahead, Las Vegas faces both opportunities and challenges. The city's strong earnings growth and relatively low cost of living make it an attractive location for workers and businesses. However, the cooling housing market and significant drop in construction permits highlight potential vulnerabilities, particularly if the tourism sector falters. Policymakers will need to focus on diversifying the economy and supporting sustainable growth in the real estate sector to ensure long-term stability.
