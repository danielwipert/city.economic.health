# Pittsburgh — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Pittsburgh's economy presents a complex mix of indicators, with some robust signs alongside areas of concern. The city's labor market is characterised by an unemployment rate of 4.7%, slightly above the national average, and a relatively low labour force participation rate of 60.7%. However, earnings growth has been strong, increasing by 4.92% year-over-year, placing it in the 60th percentile nationally. This suggests that while employment levels may not be expanding rapidly, those who are employed are seeing significant wage gains.

Business activity, as measured by the number of new building permits, has declined sharply by 24.33% year-over-year, indicating a slowdown in construction and potential cooling in the real estate market. In contrast, the housing market remains a bright spot, with home prices rising by 16.85% year-over-year, placing Pittsburgh in the 78th percentile nationally. The relatively low days-on-market figure of 53 days suggests healthy demand, despite higher prices. However, the decline in building permits could signal future supply constraints, exacerbating affordability issues.

The cost of living in Pittsburgh, growing at 4.34% year-over-year, is a concern, particularly for lower-income residents, as it outpaces wage growth in many sectors. To address these challenges, Pittsburgh's economy will need to balance job creation and wage growth, while managing the potential overheating of its housing market. The city's strong earnings growth and robust housing prices suggest underlying economic strength, but these positive trends must be balanced against the risks of overreliance on a few key sectors and the need for broader economic diversification.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Pittsburgh's economy presents a mixed picture, with some robust indicators alongside areas of concern. The labor market is characterized by an unemployment rate of 4.7%, slightly above the national average, and a labor force participation rate of 60.7%, which is relatively low compared to other major metropolitan areas. However, earnings growth has been strong, increasing by 4.92% year-over-year, placing it in the 60th percentile nationally. This suggests that while employment levels may not be expanding rapidly, those who are employed are seeing significant wage gains. Business activity, as measured by the number of new building permits, has declined sharply by 24.33% year-over-year, indicating a slowdown in construction and potential cooling in the real estate market.

The housing market remains a bright spot, with home prices rising by 16.85% year-over-year, well above the national average and placing Pittsburgh in the 78th percentile. This strong appreciation is supported by a relatively low days-on-market figure of 53 days, suggesting healthy demand despite the higher prices. However, the decline in building permits could signal future supply constraints, which might exacerbate affordability issues. The cost of living in Pittsburgh, growing at 4.34% year-over-year, is also a concern, particularly for lower-income residents, as it outpaces wage growth in many sectors.

Looking ahead, Pittsburgh's economy will need to address the imbalance between job creation and wage growth, as well as manage the potential overheating of its housing market. The city's strong earnings growth and robust housing prices suggest underlying economic strength, but these positive trends must be balanced against the risks of overreliance on a few key sectors and the need for broader economic diversification.
