# Orlando — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Orlando's economy, as represented by the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford metropolitan area, presents a complex picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, slightly above the national average, indicating a relatively tight labor market with room for improvement. Labor force participation remains steady at 64.44%, suggesting a stable engagement level among the working-age population.

However, earnings growth has slowed to 2.81% year-over-year, below the national average, and may reflect broader economic headwinds or sector-specific challenges. Affordability pressures are evident in the cost of living index, which has risen by 5.26%, and the owner-occupied housing rate, which stands at 3.9%. The housing market is particularly strained, with home prices increasing by 16.16% year-over-year, outpacing income growth and potentially limiting affordability for first-time buyers.

Business activity is mixed, with a decline in building permits of 3.79% year-over-year, possibly indicating a cooling in the construction sector or a shift in investment priorities. The median days on market for homes has increased to 81 days, suggesting a slowdown in the housing market linked to higher interest rates and affordability issues. Despite these challenges, Orlando's tourism and service sectors continue to support employment and consumer spending.

The low percentile score in weekly hours worked (20th percentile) suggests that while jobs are available, the intensity of work may be lower than in other metro areas. To maintain its economic momentum, Orlando must address the growing disparity between wage growth and housing costs. Diversifying its economy beyond tourism and attracting high-value industries will be crucial in sustaining long-term growth and resilience.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Orlando's economy, as represented by the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford metropolitan area, exhibits a mix of robust and cautionary signals. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, slightly above the national average, indicating a relatively tight labor market but with room for improvement. Labor force participation is steady at 64.44%, suggesting a stable engagement level among the working-age population. However, earnings growth has slowed to 2.81% year-over-year, which is below the national average and may reflect broader economic headwinds or sector-specific challenges. The cost of living index at 5.26% and the owner-occupied housing rate at 3.9% suggest moderate affordability pressures, particularly in the housing market, where home prices have risen by 16.16% year-over-year, outpacing income growth and potentially straining affordability for first-time buyers.

Business activity shows mixed signals, with a decline in building permits by 3.79% year-over-year, possibly reflecting a cooling in the construction sector or a shift in investment priorities. The median days on market for homes has increased to 81 days, indicating a slowdown in the housing market that could be linked to higher interest rates and affordability issues. Despite these challenges, Orlando's strong tourism and service sectors continue to support employment and consumer spending. The low percentile score in weekly hours worked (20th percentile) suggests that while jobs are available, the intensity of work may be lower than in other metro areas.

Looking ahead, Orlando will need to address the growing disparity between wage growth and housing costs to maintain its economic momentum. The city's ability to diversify its economy beyond tourism and attract high-value industries will be crucial in sustaining long-term growth and resilience.
