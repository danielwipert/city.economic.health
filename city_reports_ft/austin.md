# Austin — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Austin's economy presents a mixed picture, reflecting both resilience and emerging challenges. The labour market remains robust, with an unemployment rate of 3.9%, placing it in the 70th percentile nationally, and a high labour force participation rate of 73.46%, in the 96th percentile. This strong workforce is capable of sustaining economic growth, but earnings growth has moderated to 5.02% year-over-year, ranking in the 62nd percentile and indicating some cooling in wage dynamics. Workers are maintaining their economic activity levels, with average weekly hours worked at 35.3, in the 86th percentile.

The housing market, however, shows signs of stress. Home prices have declined by 10.76% year-over-year, a significant drop that places Austin in the bottom percentile. This decline, coupled with a 37.08% decrease in building permits, suggests a cooling in the construction sector and a potential shift in housing demand. The lengthening of days on market, now at 80, is another indicator of weakening demand.

Business activity, as measured by the cost of living and other operational costs, remains relatively stable but is not without pressure, with the cost of living increasing by 4.64% year-over-year. Austin's strong labour market and engaged workforce provide a solid foundation for economic resilience. However, the housing market's downturn and the slowdown in construction pose challenges if these trends persist. Policymakers and businesses will need to monitor these developments closely, particularly as they relate to broader economic conditions and the potential for further shifts in the local economy.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Austin's economy presents a mixed picture, reflecting both resilience and emerging challenges. The labor market remains robust, with an unemployment rate of 3.9%, placing it in the 70th percentile nationally, and a high labor force participation rate of 73.46%, which is in the 96th percentile. These figures suggest a strong and engaged workforce, capable of sustaining economic growth. However, earnings growth has moderated to 5.02% year-over-year, a figure that ranks in the 62nd percentile, indicating some cooling in wage dynamics. The average weekly hours worked (35.3) remain high, in the 86th percentile, suggesting that despite slower earnings growth, workers are maintaining their economic activity levels.

The housing market, however, shows signs of stress. Home prices have declined by 10.76% year-over-year, a significant drop that places Austin in the bottom percentile. This decline, coupled with a 37.08% decrease in building permits, suggests a cooling in the construction sector and a potential shift in housing demand. Additionally, properties are taking longer to sell, with days on market increasing to 80, another indicator of weakening demand. Business activity, as measured by the cost of living and other operational costs, remains relatively stable but is not without pressure, with the cost of living increasing by 4.64% year-over-year.

Looking ahead, Austin's strong labor market and engaged workforce provide a solid foundation for economic resilience. However, the housing market's downturn and the slowdown in construction could pose challenges if these trends persist. Policymakers and businesses will need to monitor these developments closely, particularly as they relate to broader economic conditions and the potential for further shifts in the local economy.
