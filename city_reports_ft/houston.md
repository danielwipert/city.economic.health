# Houston — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Here's the edited column:

Houston's economy presents a complex picture, marked by both resilience and areas of concern. The city's unemployment rate stands at 5.0%, placing it in the 16th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively high joblessness rate compared to other major metropolitan areas. In contrast, the labor force participation rate is 64.31%, close to the national average, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population remains engaged in the labor market.

Earnings growth year-over-year is a moderate 3.23%, in line with broader economic trends but potentially insufficient to outpace inflation, which is currently estimated at 4.73%. The cost of living, while higher than the historical average, remains manageable for many residents.

The housing market is a notable area of concern. Annual home price growth is robust at 10.73%, which could be driven by strong demand or limited supply, or both. However, this growth is tempered by a decline in building permits, down 6.1% year-over-year, potentially signaling a slowdown in new construction. The days on market for homes have increased to 57, which might indicate cooling demand or an adjustment in buyer expectations.

Business activity, as measured by weekly hours worked, is notably high at 36.8 hours, placing Houston in the 98th percentile and suggesting strong engagement from the employed workforce. However, the office vacancy rate has worsened slightly, down 1.71% year-over-year, which could reflect changes in corporate real estate strategies post-pandemic.

Looking ahead, Houston's economy appears to be navigating a period of transition. While the labor market and business activity show signs of strength, the housing market and employment metrics suggest caution. To achieve long-term resilience, the city will need to address the imbalance between housing demand and supply, and possibly stimulate job creation to reduce unemployment. Diversifying beyond traditional sectors like energy and leveraging its strategic location and skilled workforce to attract new industries and investment will be crucial to the city's future growth prospects.

Houston's economic landscape presents a mixed picture, reflecting both resilience and areas of concern. The unemployment rate stands at 5.0%, placing it in the 16th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively high joblessness rate compared to other major metropolitan areas. However, the labor force participation rate is at 64.31%, which is closer to the national average, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population remains engaged in the labor market. Earnings growth year-over-year is at 3.23%, a moderate increase that aligns with broader economic trends but may not be sufficient to outpace inflation, currently estimated at 4.73%. The cost of living, while higher than the historical average, is still manageable for many residents.

In the housing market, the annual increase in home prices is robust at 10.73%, which could be a sign of strong demand or limited supply, or both. However, this growth is tempered by a decline in building permits, down 6.1% year-over-year, potentially signaling a slowdown in new construction.

The city will need to address the imbalance between housing demand and supply, and possibly stimulate job creation to reduce unemployment. Long-term resilience will depend on diversifying beyond traditional sectors like energy and leveraging its strategic location and skilled workforce to attract new industries and investment.
