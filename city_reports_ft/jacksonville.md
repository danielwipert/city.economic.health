# Jacksonville — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Jacksonville's economy presents a complex picture, with both robust and concerning indicators. The labour market is relatively stable, with an unemployment rate of 4.6%, slightly above the national average, yet indicative of a tight job market. Labour force participation stands at 60.61%, below the national average, suggesting potential underutilization of the workforce. However, earnings growth is strong, up 9.66% year-over-year, placing it in the 98th percentile nationally. This significant wage growth may be a response to tight labour conditions, potentially attracting more individuals into the workforce over time.

Affordability pressures are moderate, with a cost of living index of 4.4% and an owner-occupied housing rate of 1.72%. These rates are not as severe as in many other major metropolitan areas. The housing sector reflects continued demand, with an annual increase in home prices of 12.27%. However, a slight decline in building permits (-2.63% year-over-year) and an increase in days on market to 76 days suggest a cooling in the market, possibly due to higher mortgage rates or a saturation of inventory.

Business activity, as measured by weekly hours worked (33.6 hours), is modest, and the decrease in permits also suggests a cautious approach to expansion. Despite these challenges, Jacksonville's strong earnings growth and relatively stable housing market provide a foundation for resilience.

To fully capitalize on its wage growth and maintain economic momentum, Jacksonville will need to address its lower labour force participation. The housing market's adjustment period may present opportunities for both buyers and sellers, but policymakers should closely monitor this to ensure it does not lead to a broader economic slowdown. Overall, while facing near-term adjustments, Jacksonville's economy shows underlying strengths that position it well for future growth.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Jacksonville's economy presents a mixed picture, with some robust indicators alongside areas of concern. The labor market is relatively stable, with an unemployment rate of 4.6%, slightly above the national average but indicative of a tight job market. Labor force participation stands at 60.61%, which is below the national average, suggesting potential underutilization of the workforce. However, earnings growth is strong, up 9.66% year-over-year, placing it in the 98th percentile nationally. This significant wage growth could be a response to tight labor conditions, potentially attracting more individuals into the workforce over time. The cost of living index at 4.4% and the owner-occupied housing rate at 1.72% suggest moderate affordability pressures, though these are not as severe as in many other major metropolitan areas.

In the housing sector, the annual increase in home prices of 12.27% reflects continued demand, despite a slight decline in building permits (-2.63% year-over-year), which might indicate a slowdown in new construction. The days on market for homes have increased to 76 days, pointing to a cooling in the housing market, possibly due to higher mortgage rates or a saturation of inventory. Business activity, as measured by the weekly hours worked (33.6 hours), is modest, and the decrease in permits also suggests a cautious approach to expansion. Despite these challenges, Jacksonville's strong earnings growth and relatively stable housing market provide a foundation for resilience.

Looking ahead, Jacksonville will need to address the lower labor force participation to fully capitalize on its wage growth and maintain economic momentum. The housing market's adjustment period may present opportunities for both buyers and sellers, but policymakers should monitor this closely to ensure it does not lead to a broader economic slowdown. Overall, while facing some near-term adjustments, Jacksonville's economy shows underlying strengths that position it well for future growth.
