# Sacramento — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Here's the edited column:

Sacramento's economy presents a nuanced picture, with some promising signs tempered by significant challenges. The city's unemployment rate of 5.4% is slightly above the national average, suggesting a labour market that, while stable, lags behind many other metropolitan areas. Labour force participation stands at 60.62%, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Earnings growth year-over-year is a modest 4.1%, in line with broader national trends but hinting at limited wage pressure. The cost of living index of 5.65 indicates that living expenses are relatively high, potentially deterring residents and potential migrants.

The housing market is a particular area of concern. Home prices have grown by a mere 0.95% year-over-year, indicating a cooling market after a period of rapid appreciation. This trend is corroborated by a 30.14% decline in building permits, suggesting a slowdown in new construction. The median days on market for homes is 58, a relatively high figure that points to a less active real estate market. Business activity, as measured by weekly hours worked (33.3), is also below the national average, suggesting a less intensive use of labour resources. These factors collectively point to a cautious economic environment in Sacramento, with businesses and consumers potentially holding back on major investments and purchases.

Looking ahead, Sacramento faces the challenge of sustaining economic momentum in a context of high living costs and a cooling housing market. To address this, the region will need to focus on diversifying its economy and attracting investment to stimulate job creation and wage growth. Improving the city's economic grade, currently rated as "Critical" (C-), will be crucial for ensuring long-term stability and prosperity.
