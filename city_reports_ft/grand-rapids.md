# Grand Rapids — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Here's the revised column:

Grand Rapids, a metropolitan area encompassing Wyoming and Kentwood, presents a mixed economic picture. The unemployment rate of 4.8% places it in the 20th percentile for employment conditions, slightly above the national average. However, the labor force participation rate of 65.6% is robust, indicating a strong engagement of the working-age population in the labor market. Earnings growth of 4.35% year-over-year is moderate, in line with broader economic trends. The cost of living in Grand Rapids is relatively low, at 69% of the national average, enhancing the purchasing power of residents.

The labor market's modest but positive balance between job openings and hires is reflected in an over-the-week ratio of 1.74. In the housing sector, Grand Rapids has seen a significant increase in home prices, with a year-over-year growth of 20.55%, placing it in the 90th percentile. This rapid appreciation is a double-edged sword, reflecting strong demand but also posing affordability challenges. The decline in building permits by 8.64% year-over-year could signal a slowdown in new housing supply, potentially exacerbating affordability issues. The median days on market for homes is 42 days, a reasonable timeframe suggesting a balanced market.

Business activity is solid, with weekly hours worked averaging 34.8 hours. The professional services and finance sectors are showing healthy growth, with a 5.0% year-over-year increase in professional services firms. Looking ahead, Grand Rapids' economy appears to be on a stable trajectory, supported by a strong labor market and relatively low cost of living. However, the rapid increase in home prices and the decline in building permits suggest that the housing market may face challenges in maintaining affordability. Policymakers and businesses will need to address these issues to ensure sustainable growth and maintain the city's appeal as a place to live and work.
