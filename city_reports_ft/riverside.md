# Riverside — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Riverside, part of the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metropolitan area, presents a complex economic landscape. The city boasts a tight labor market, with an unemployment rate of 6.1%, placing it in the lower 2nd percentile nationally. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.02% is relatively modest, suggesting some underutilization of the workforce.

Earnings growth in Riverside is robust, rising 8.72% year-over-year and outpacing the national average by a significant margin, placing the city in the 90th percentile. This strong earnings growth is a key driver of the local economy, supporting consumer spending and overall economic activity.

The housing market in Riverside is marked by both strength and stress. The housing price index has increased by 9.42% year-over-year, driven by strong demand and limited supply. However, the decline in building permits, down 18.53% year-over-year, indicates a slowdown in new construction that could exacerbate housing affordability issues. The median days on market of 63 is relatively high, suggesting that while demand is strong, the market is not as brisk as in some other regions.

Business activity in Riverside is moderate, with the cost of living 5.43% above the national average and the owner-occupied housing rate at 1.3, both of which are within the lower half of national percentiles. In the short term, the city's economy is supported by strong earnings growth and a relatively low unemployment rate. However, longer-term challenges include a declining rate of new housing construction and a modest labor force participation rate, which could limit economic expansion.

The city's economic grade of C+ reflects these mixed signals, with Riverside needing to address housing supply and labor market participation to sustain its economic momentum.
