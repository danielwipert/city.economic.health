# Atlanta — Economic Overview (FT Style)

## Polished FT-style column

Atlanta's economy presents a nuanced picture, with a resilient labour market offset by weakening housing and business activity. The city's unemployment rate stands at 3.5%, placing it in the 86th percentile, significantly lower than the national average. Labour force participation, however, lags at 64.14%, suggesting room for improvement in workforce engagement. Earnings growth is robust, with a year-over-year increase of 6.47% – in the 80th percentile – driven by strong wage pressures and economic activity. Yet, the cost of living has risen by 4.59%, potentially eroding some of the gains in earnings.

On the housing front, the year-over-year change in the housing price index is a modest 0.17%, indicating a relatively stable market. However, a 20.77% decline in building permits suggests a slowdown in new construction, while a 60-day increase in the number of days properties remain on the market could indicate cooling demand. Business activity, as measured by the year-over-year change in the number of establishments, has decreased by 1.18%, pointing to a cautious business environment.

Atlanta's overall economic health, reflected in its weighted percentile score of 54.1, remains average, with a grade of B. To sustain its economic momentum, the city must address the slowdown in housing and business activity while maintaining its strong labour market. Attracting new businesses and investment will be crucial. Policymakers should focus on strategies to enhance labour force participation and manage the cost of living to ensure that economic benefits are broadly shared.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Atlanta's economic landscape presents a mixed picture, with strong labor market indicators contrasting with weakening housing and business activity metrics. The city's unemployment rate stands at 3.5%, placing it in the 86th percentile, which is significantly lower than the national average, indicating a robust job market. Labor force participation is at 64.14%, slightly below the national average, suggesting room for improvement in bringing more individuals into the workforce. Earnings growth is robust, with a year-over-year increase of 6.47%, which is in the 80th percentile, reflecting strong wage pressures and economic activity. However, the cost of living has risen by 4.59% year-over-year, which may erode some of the gains in earnings.

On the housing front, the year-over-year change in the housing price index is a modest 0.17%, indicating a relatively stable market, but this is coupled with a 20.77% decline in building permits, suggesting a slowdown in new construction. The number of days properties remain on the market has increased to 60 days, up from previous levels, which could indicate a cooling in demand. Business activity, as measured by the year-over-year change in the number of establishments, has decreased by 1.18%, pointing to a cautious business environment. Despite these challenges, Atlanta's overall economic health, as reflected in its weighted percentile score of 54.1, remains average, with a grade of B.

Looking ahead, Atlanta will need to address the slowdown in housing and business activity while maintaining its strong labor market. The city's ability to attract new businesses and investment will be crucial in sustaining its economic momentum. Policymakers should focus on strategies to enhance labor force participation and manage the cost of living to ensure that the economic benefits are broadly shared.
