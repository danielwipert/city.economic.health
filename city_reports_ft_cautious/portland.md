# Portland — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 5.3%, placing it in the 10th percentile nationally. This suggests a relatively higher unemployment level compared to other metropolitan areas. Conversely, the labor force participation rate of 66.84% ranks in the 74th percentile, indicating a higher proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labor market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 1.43%, placing the region in the 14th percentile. This may reflect a slower pace of wage increases. The cost of living index is 5.66, slightly above the national average and ranking in the 18th percentile. Housing market indicators show a decline in both home prices and permits issued. Home prices have fallen by 0.24% year-over-year, while building permits are down by 20.27% year-over-year. The median days on market for homes is 71 days, which is relatively high.

The data suggests that while Portland's labor market engagement remains strong, there are signs of economic softness in terms of employment, earnings growth and the housing market.
