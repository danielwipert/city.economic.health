# Portland — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture, with some indicators showing relative strength and others pointing to areas of concern. The unemployment rate of 5.0% places it in the 12th percentile among comparable regions, indicating a labour market that is less robust than many peers. Conversely, the labour force participation rate of 66.5% ranks in the 70th percentile, suggesting a relatively high level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth of 4.05% is moderate, sitting in the 40th percentile, while the cost of living increase of 5.36% is slightly above average, at the 24th percentile. These figures suggest that wage growth may not be keeping pace with the rising cost of living.

In the housing market, the year-over-year change in home prices has declined by 0.59%, placing the region in the 14th percentile, which indicates a cooling trend in property values. The number of building permits has decreased by 20.27% year-over-year, ranking in the 28th percentile, suggesting a slowdown in construction activity. The median days on market for homes has increased to 74 days, in the 10th percentile, which may reflect a softer demand for housing. Additionally, the year-over-year change in rental prices has fallen by 1.8%, in the 32nd percentile, further indicating a less dynamic real estate sector.

The data suggests a metropolitan area experiencing moderate economic conditions, with signs of softening in both the labour and housing markets.
