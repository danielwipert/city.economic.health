# Portland — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.8%, placing it in the 18th percentile among comparable regions, indicating a labour market that is performing below average in terms of job availability. Conversely, the labour force participation rate of 66.84% ranks in the 74th percentile, suggesting a relatively high level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth is at 4.05%, situated in the 40th percentile, indicating moderate wage increases.

Housing and construction metrics are less positive. Building permits have declined by 21.47% year-over-year, ranking in the 20th percentile, which may reflect a slowdown in residential and commercial development. The housing price index has decreased by 0.59% over the same period, placing it in the 14th percentile, and the days on market for properties have increased to 86 days, in the 2nd percentile, indicating a less active real estate market. The cost of living index is 5.33% above the national average, in the 26th percentile, and weekly hours worked stand at 34.6 hours, in the 58th percentile, both of which suggest moderate pressures on household budgets and work schedules.

The data suggests a regional economy with labour market strengths but facing challenges in housing and construction activity.
