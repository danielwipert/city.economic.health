# Portland — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate of 5.0% places it in the 12th percentile nationally, indicating a labour market that is less robust compared to other regions. Conversely, the labour force participation rate of 66.5% ranks in the 70th percentile, suggesting a relatively high level of engagement among the working-age population.

Earnings growth over the past year has been modest, at 1.59%, placing it in the 24th percentile. This may reflect broader economic conditions or sector-specific trends. The housing market has also shown signs of cooling, with the annual change in home prices declining by 0.24% and building permits decreasing by 20.27% year-over-year. These figures rank in the lower percentiles (20th and 28th, respectively).

The cost of living index of 5.68 and the overall wage ratio of 1.52 are both in the lower middle range of national comparisons, potentially indicating moderate living costs and wage levels relative to other metropolitan areas. The average days on market for homes has increased to 74 days, ranking in the 10th percentile. This may be a result of a slowdown in buyer activity or an oversupply of properties.

The data suggests that the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro metropolitan area has a labour market that is moderately engaged but faces challenges in employment and earnings growth, alongside a housing market that appears to be cooling.
