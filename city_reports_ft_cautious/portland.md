# Portland — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 5.3%, placing it in the 10th percentile among similar regions. This suggests a relatively high level of joblessness compared to peers. In contrast, the labor force participation rate of 66.84% ranks in the 74th percentile, indicating a higher proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labor market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 1.59%, placing the region in the 24th percentile. This may reflect a slower pace of wage increases compared to other areas. The cost of living index of 5.68 and the overall well-being ratio of 1.52 both rank below average, in the 22nd and 16th percentiles, respectively. Housing market indicators show a decline in both home prices and permits issued. Home prices have fallen 0.24% year-over-year, and building permits have decreased by 20.27%. Both metrics are in lower percentiles, indicating a cooling in the housing sector. The days on market metric of 74 days, in the 10th percentile, further supports this trend, suggesting longer times to sell properties.

The data suggests the region has moderate economic performance, with challenges in employment and housing markets, but a relatively strong labor force participation rate.
