## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 5.0%, placing it in the 12th percentile among comparable regions. This suggests a relatively higher unemployment level compared with other areas.

The labor force participation rate is 66.5%, ranking in the 70th percentile. This indicates a higher proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labor market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 1.59%, placing the region in the 24th percentile. The cost of living increase of 5.68% is slightly above the national average, ranking in the 22nd percentile. This disparity may indicate challenges in maintaining purchasing power for local residents.
