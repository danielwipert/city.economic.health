## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The economic data for the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro metropolitan area reveals a mixed picture, with some indicators showing relative strength while others point to areas of concern. The unemployment rate stands at 4.8%, placing it in the 18th percentile nationally, which suggests that the local job market is tighter than in many other regions. However, the labor force participation rate of 66.84% is higher than the national median, indicating a relatively active workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth of 4.78% is moderate, ranking in the 64th percentile, suggesting that wage increases are keeping pace with inflation to some extent.

On the housing front, the year-over-year change in home prices has declined by 0.62%, and the number of building permits has fallen by 17.1%, both of which are below the national median. These figures may reflect a cooling in the housing market, potentially influenced by broader economic trends or local factors. Additionally, the average days on market for homes has increased to 86 days, placing it in the 2nd percentile, which could indicate a slowdown in sales activity. The overall weighted percentile score of 35.7 and the grade of C+ suggest that while Portland's economy is performing adequately, there are significant areas for improvement.

In summary, the data indicates a stable but not robust economic environment in Portland, with strengths in employment and labor force participation offset by challenges in the housing sector.
