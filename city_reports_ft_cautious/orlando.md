# Orlando — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford metropolitan area's economic data reveals a mixed performance across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 4.1%, slightly above the national average, placing it in the 44th percentile among similar regions. Labour force participation is at 64.5%, aligning with the same percentile rank, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the labour market. Year-over-year earnings growth is reported at 4.63%, a relatively stable rate that places the region in the 48th percentile, suggesting modest income growth.

Housing market indicators show a more varied picture. The year-over-year increase in home prices is 10.12%, placing the region in the 64th percentile, which may reflect continued demand. However, building permits have decreased by 3.79% year-over-year, ranking in the 44th percentile, potentially indicating a slowdown in new construction activity. Rental prices have decreased by 2.56% per square foot, placing the region in the 20th percentile. The median days on market for homes has increased to 80 days, higher than in many other markets, which could suggest a less competitive selling environment.

The data suggests that Orlando's economy exhibits both areas of strength and moderation. Housing prices are a notable exception, while labour market dynamics and construction activity appear to be showing signs of moderation.
