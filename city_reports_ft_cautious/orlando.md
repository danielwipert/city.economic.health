## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford metropolitan area ranks 20th in a recent economic assessment, with a weighted percentile score of 40.4, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, which is slightly above the national average, and the labor force participation rate is 64.44%, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth is recorded at 2.81%, suggesting a modest improvement in income levels. However, the cost of living has increased by 5.26% over the same period, potentially eroding purchasing power.

Housing market indicators present a mixed picture. The year-over-year increase in home prices is 10.12%, which is relatively robust, while the number of single-family housing permits has decreased by 3.79%, possibly reflecting a slowdown in new construction. The median days on market for homes is 81 days, which is relatively high, indicating a less active market compared to periods of stronger demand. Additionally, the year-over-year change in the price-to-square-foot ratio has declined by 2.83%, which may reflect a softening in the housing market's premium per unit area.

Overall, the data suggests that while Orlando's economy shows some areas of strength, particularly in housing prices, there are also signs of moderation in employment and housing activity.
