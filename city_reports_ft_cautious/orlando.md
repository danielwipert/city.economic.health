# Orlando — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, placing it near the median when compared to other metropolitan areas, with a percentile score of 48. Labor force participation is also at 64.44%, in line with the unemployment rate's position. Earnings growth over the past year has been modest at 2.18%, ranking in the lower third of metropolitan areas with a percentile score of 30. This suggests that wage increases may not be keeping pace with inflation, which is estimated at 5.34% based on the cost of living index.

The housing market in Orlando is characterised by a 10.12% year-over-year increase in the housing price index, placing the region in the upper quartile with a percentile score of 64. However, this growth contrasts with a 3.79% year-over-year decline in building permits, indicating a potential slowdown in new construction activity. The average days on market for homes is 80 days, higher than many other markets, suggesting a less dynamic sales environment. The rental market appears to be softening, with a 2.56% year-over-year decrease in rents, placing the region in the bottom quintile with a percentile score of 20.

The weighted percentile score of 39.3 and the grade of C+ suggest that Orlando's economy is performing below average relative to other metropolitan areas. The data highlights both strengths, such as housing prices, and challenges, including earnings growth and labor market dynamics.
