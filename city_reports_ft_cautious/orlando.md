# Orlando — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, placing it near the median when compared to other metropolitan areas, with a percentile score of 48. Labor force participation is also at 64.44%, in line with the unemployment rate's position. Earnings growth year-over-year is 2.81%, ranking in the lower third of all metro areas, with a percentile score of 36. The cost of living index is 5.26%, slightly below the median, suggesting that wage growth may not be keeping pace with price increases.

The housing market in Orlando shows contrasting trends. Home prices have increased by 16.16% year-over-year, placing the region in the 74th percentile, indicating a robust housing market. However, this growth is accompanied by a decline in building permits, down 3.79% year-over-year, and an increase in days on market to 81 days, suggesting a potential slowdown in new construction and a less dynamic sales environment. The overall weighted percentile score of 41.4 and the grade of B- reflect a below-average performance across the board, integrating these various economic indicators.

The data points suggest a complex economic landscape in Orlando, with the housing market showing relative strength, while employment and earnings performance is more moderate.
