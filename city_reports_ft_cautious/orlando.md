# Orlando — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford metropolitan area's economic data reveals a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 4.1%, slightly above the national average, placing it at the 44th percentile among similar regions. Labour force participation is also at 64.5%, aligning with the same percentile rank. Year-over-year earnings growth is 2.18%, ranking in the 30th percentile, while the cost of living has increased by 5.34%, placing it in the 36th percentile. These figures suggest that wage growth may not be keeping pace with inflation, potentially affecting household purchasing power.

In the housing market, the year-over-year increase in home prices is 10.12%, ranking in the 64th percentile, indicating continued demand despite a decline in building permits, which fell by 3.79% year-over-year, placing it in the 44th percentile. The days on market metric is 80 days, ranking in the 4th percentile, which may reflect a slowdown in sales activity or an oversupply of homes. The year-over-year change in the price-to-square-foot ratio has decreased by 2.56%, ranking in the 20th percentile, indicating a potential softening in the real estate market.

The weighted percentile score of 38.1 and the grade of C+ suggest that Orlando's economic performance is below average compared to other metropolitan areas, with particular challenges in the labour market and housing sector.
