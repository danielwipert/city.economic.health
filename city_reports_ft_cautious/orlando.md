## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford metropolitan area ranks 20th in a recent economic assessment, with a weighted percentile score of 40.4, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, which is slightly above the national average, and the labor force participation rate is 64.44%, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth is recorded at 2.81%, a modest increase that suggests a steady but not particularly robust improvement in income levels.

Housing market indicators present a mixed picture. The year-over-year change in housing prices is up by 10.12%, suggesting continued demand despite a decline in building permits by 3.79% over the same period. The days on market metric has increased to 81 days, which may reflect a cooling in the pace of sales. Additionally, the year-over-year change in the price-to-square-foot ratio has decreased by 2.83%, potentially indicating a shift in buyer preferences or a softening in the premium paid per square foot.

Overall, the data indicates a region with stable but not dynamic economic activity, with some sectors showing signs of moderation.
