# Orlando — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate is 4.8%, placing the region in the 18th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively stable labour market. The labour force participation rate of 64.05% is slightly above the median, suggesting a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth of 4.63% is consistent with broader national trends.

The housing market is notable for a year-over-year increase in home prices of 10.12%, placing Orlando in the 64th percentile. However, the decline in single-family housing permits by 1.96% year-over-year may indicate a slowdown in new construction activity. The days-on-market metric of 83 days is high, placing the region in the 6th percentile, which could suggest challenges in selling properties or a shift in buyer behaviour. The year-over-year decrease in permits for multifamily structures by 2.58% further suggests a potential cooling in the housing sector.

The data suggests that Orlando's economy is experiencing moderate growth, with some signs of softening in the housing market.
