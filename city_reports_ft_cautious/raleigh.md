The unemployment rate of 3.2% places it in the 88th percentile, indicating a relatively low level of joblessness compared to other regions. The labour force participation rate of 67.86% is above average, ranking in the 76th percentile, suggesting a high level of engagement of the working-age population in the labour market. However, the year-over-year earnings growth of 2.94% falls in the 44th percentile, which may indicate a slower pace of wage increases relative to other areas.

Housing market indicators show a contrasting trend. The year-over-year increase in home prices of 8.65% places the region in the 58th percentile, suggesting moderate appreciation. Conversely, the decline in building permits by 28.25% year-over-year, situated in the 16th percentile, points to a significant reduction in new construction activity. The days on market metric of 65 days, also in the 16th percentile, indicates that properties are taking longer to sell.

Overall, the data suggests a balanced economic environment in Raleigh-Cary, with strengths in employment and labour force participation offset by more subdued indicators in housing and earnings growth.
