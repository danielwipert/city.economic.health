# Riverside — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 6.1%, placing it in the 2nd percentile, indicating a relatively high level of joblessness compared to other regions. The labour force participation rate is 60.02%, in the 6th percentile, suggesting a lower proportion of the working-age population is either employed or actively seeking employment. Earnings growth year-over-year is 8.72%, ranking in the 90th percentile, which may reflect strong wage increases or improvements in employment quality.

Housing market indicators show both strength and weakness. The housing price index has increased by 9.42% year-over-year, placing it in the 52nd percentile, suggesting moderate appreciation in home values. However, the number of building permits has declined by 18.53% year-over-year, in the 30th percentile, which could indicate a slowdown in new construction activity. The supply of homes for sale has decreased slightly by 1.27% year-over-year, in the 34th percentile, while the average days on market is 63 days, in the 18th percentile.

The weighted percentile score of 31.4 and the grade of C+ suggest that Riverside's economic performance is below average relative to other metropolitan areas. Notable strengths in earnings growth are offset by challenges in employment and housing market dynamics.
