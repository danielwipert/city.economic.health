# Riverside — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate of 6.1% places the region in the lower 2nd percentile nationally, which may indicate a relatively tighter labor market. Conversely, the labor force participation rate of 60.02% is in the 6th percentile, suggesting a relatively low share of the working-age population actively participating in the labor market.

Earnings growth year-over-year is 8.72%, ranking in the 90th percentile, indicating significant wage increases for those employed. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is at 5.43%, in the 24th percentile, indicating moderate price pressures.

The housing market shows a year-over-year increase in home prices of 7.22%, placing the region in the 52nd percentile, suggesting a stable market. However, the number of building permits has declined by 18.53% year-over-year, ranking in the 30th percentile, which may indicate a slowdown in new construction activity. The days on market metric is 63 days, in the 18th percentile, suggesting a relatively slower pace of home sales.

The overall weighted percentile score is 31.4, and the corresponding grade is C+. This suggests that while some sectors are performing relatively well, the broader economic landscape faces challenges.
