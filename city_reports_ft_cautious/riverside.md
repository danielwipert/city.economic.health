# Riverside — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate of 6.1% ranks in the lower 2nd percentile among other regions, indicating a relatively high level of joblessness. The labour force participation rate of 60.02% is below average, ranking in the 6th percentile, suggesting a lower proportion of the working-age population is either employed or actively seeking employment. Earnings growth over the past year has been 7.71%, placing it in the 88th percentile, indicating significant wage increases for those employed. However, the cost of living index of 5.61% and the weekly hours worked of 33.9 hours per week, both in the 24th and 38th percentiles respectively, suggest moderate pressures on household budgets and work schedules.

In the housing market, the annual increase in home prices of 7.22% ranks in the 52nd percentile, reflecting a steady but not rapid appreciation in property values. The supply of single-family homes has decreased by 0.88% year-over-year, ranking in the 48th percentile, which may indicate a tightening market. The number of building permits issued has declined by 18.53% year-over-year, placing it in the 30th percentile, which could suggest a slowdown in new construction activity. The median days on market for homes is 61 days, in the 32nd percentile, indicating a balanced market.

The data suggests a region with both areas of strength, such as earnings growth, and challenges in employment and housing market dynamics.
