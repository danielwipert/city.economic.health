# Riverside — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 5.4%, placing it in the 4th percentile among comparable regions. The labor force participation rate of 60.71% ranks in the 18th percentile, indicating a portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labor market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 7.77%, placing the region in the 78th percentile. However, building permits have declined by 15.14% year-over-year, which may reflect a slowdown in construction activity. Home prices have increased by 7.22% over the year, while rental prices have decreased by 0.39%. Properties take an average of 71 days to sell, a relatively long period.

The weighted percentile score of 29.1 and the assigned grade of "C" suggest that while there are some positive economic developments in Riverside, the region faces ongoing challenges in employment and housing market dynamics.

The economic data for the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metropolitan area presents a mixed picture, with some indicators showing positive trends while others point to challenges. The unemployment rate stands at 5.4%, placing it in the 4th percentile among comparable regions, which suggests a relatively high level of joblessness. The labor force participation rate of 60.71% is also below average, ranking in the 18th percentile, indicating that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labor market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been robust, with a 7.77% increase, placing the region in the 78th percentile, a strong performance relative to other areas. However, this is somewhat offset by a decline in building permits, down 15.14% year-over-year, which may reflect a slowdown in construction activity. The housing market shows moderate appreciation, with home prices increasing by 7.22% over the year, while rental prices have slightly decreased by 0.39%. Properties are taking an average of 71 days to sell, which is a relatively long period, suggesting a less dynamic real estate market.
