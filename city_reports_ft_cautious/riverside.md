# Riverside — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 5.9%, placing it in the 2nd percentile, indicating a relatively high level of joblessness compared to other regions. The labor force participation rate is 60.25%, in the 6th percentile, suggesting a lower proportion of the working-age population is either employed or actively seeking employment. Earnings growth year-over-year is 7.71%, ranking in the 88th percentile, which may reflect a strong demand for labor or higher productivity in the region.

Housing market indicators show divergent trends. The housing price index has increased by 7.22% year-over-year, placing it in the 52nd percentile, suggesting moderate appreciation in home values. However, the number of building permits has declined by 18.53% year-over-year, in the 30th percentile, which could indicate a slowdown in new construction activity. The supply of existing homes for sale has decreased slightly by 0.88% year-over-year, in the 48th percentile, while the average days on market is 61 days, in the 32nd percentile, indicating a relatively balanced market.

The economic performance of the Riverside-San Bernardino-Ontario metro area, as reflected in these indicators, appears to be modest. Strengths in earnings growth and housing prices are offset by challenges in employment and new construction.
