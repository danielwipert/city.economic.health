However, the labour force participation rate of 64.7% ranks in the 54th percentile, indicating that a significant portion of the working-age population remains outside the labour force. Year-over-year earnings growth has been negative, at 1.68%, which may be influenced by broader economic pressures or sector-specific issues.

In the housing market, home prices have increased by 26.71% annually, placing the region in the 98th percentile. This could be due to strong demand or limited supply. The number of building permits has risen by 16.13% year-over-year, which may be a positive sign for future housing stock. The days-on-market metric of 39 days ranks in the 96th percentile, indicating a brisk pace of sales. However, single-family home sales have declined by 0.41% year-over-year, which may reflect cooling demand or other market dynamics.
