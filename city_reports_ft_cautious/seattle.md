# Seattle — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Seattle's economic data reveals a mixed picture across various indicators. The metropolitan area's unemployment rate stands at 4.6%, placing it in the 32nd percentile nationally, indicating a relatively moderate level of labour market tightness. Meanwhile, the labour force participation rate of 68.19% ranks in the 82nd percentile, suggesting a higher engagement of the working-age population in the labour market compared to other regions.

Earnings growth year-over-year is 9.43%, ranking in the 94th percentile, which may reflect strong wage pressures or improvements in productivity. However, the data does not provide a clear explanation for this trend.

Housing market indicators present a nuanced picture. The housing price index has decreased slightly by 0.09% year-over-year, while the price-to-rent ratio has increased by 0.08%. The number of building permits issued has risen by 14.29% year-over-year, placing this metric in the 76th percentile, which could indicate ongoing construction activity despite the slight decline in home prices. Properties are taking an average of 48 days to sell, which is in line with the national median, suggesting a balanced market.

Overall, the data suggests that Seattle's economy is performing at a level that is neither exceptionally strong nor weak, with some indicators showing strengths and others moderation.
