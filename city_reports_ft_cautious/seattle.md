The Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan area ranks 15th in a recent economic assessment, with an overall grade of B, indicating average performance relative to other metro areas. The unemployment rate stands at 4.9%, placing it in the 14th percentile, which suggests a labor market that is performing below the national average. However, the labor force participation rate of 68.18% is notably high, ranking in the 84th percentile, indicating a robust engagement of the working-age population in the labor market.

Earnings growth year-over-year is strong at 9.53%, placing Seattle in the 92nd percentile, which may reflect a competitive job market and potentially higher productivity. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is at 5.24%, in the 32nd percentile, suggesting moderate price pressures. Housing market indicators show a mixed picture; while housing prices have slightly declined year-over-year by 0.39%, rental prices have also decreased by 0.15%, both placing the region in the lower percentiles (18th and 58th, respectively). The number of days properties remain on the market has increased to 56 days, in the 52nd percentile, which could indicate a cooling in the pace of sales.

Building permits have increased by 14.29% year-over-year, placing the region in the 76th percentile, suggesting ongoing investment in construction and development. Overall, the data indicates a balanced but not exceptional economic environment in Seattle, with strengths in labor force participation and earnings growth, offset by moderate inflation and a softening housing market.
