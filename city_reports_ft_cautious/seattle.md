# Seattle — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan area has an overall weighted percentile score of 56.3 in a recent economic assessment, placing it in the average range. The labour market in Seattle exhibits several characteristics. The unemployment rate is 4.9%, slightly above the national average, while the labour force participation rate is 68.18%, ranking in the 84th percentile among comparable regions. Earnings growth year-over-year is 8.65%, ranking in the 92nd percentile, indicating a positive trend in income levels. However, the cost of living index is 5.4, suggesting that earnings gains may be offset by higher living costs.

In the housing sector, the data shows a mixed picture. The year-over-year change in home prices has declined by 0.54%, which could indicate a cooling in the previously overheated real estate market. Meanwhile, the year-over-year change in permits for new residential construction has increased by 14.29%, suggesting continued interest in building despite the slight decline in home prices. The median days on market for homes is 56 days, which is neither exceptionally long nor short, and may reflect a balanced market.

These indicators suggest a diverse economic environment in Seattle, with some strengths in employment and earnings growth, but also challenges in housing affordability and cost of living.
