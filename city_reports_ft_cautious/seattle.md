## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan area economic data shows a mixed performance across various indicators. The unemployment rate is 4.6%, ranking in the 32nd percentile nationally, indicating a labour market that is neither exceptionally tight nor loose. Labour force participation is high at 68.19%, placing it in the 82nd percentile, which may reflect a high level of engagement from the working-age population in the economy. Earnings growth over the past year has been strong at 9.43%, above the national average, as indicated by its 94th percentile score.

Housing market indicators present a nuanced picture. The year-over-year change in housing prices has declined by 0.54%, placing it in the 18th percentile, which could suggest a cooling in the housing market. However, building permits have increased by 14.29% year-over-year, a figure in the 76th percentile, indicating continued investment in residential construction. The median days on market for homes is 48 days, in the 58th percentile, indicating a moderate pace of sales activity. The cost of living index is 5.35% above the national average, placing it in the 28th percentile, suggesting that living costs are higher than the national average but not among the most expensive in the country.

The data suggests that Seattle's economy is performing averagely, with strengths in labour force participation and earnings growth, but with some signs of moderation in the housing market.
