# Seattle — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Seattle's economic data suggests a mixed but generally stable environment. The metropolitan area's unemployment rate stands at 4.6%, ranking in the 32nd percentile among comparable regions. This indicates that employment conditions are not among the best but remain within a typical range for urban areas. Labour force participation is high at 68.19%, placing Seattle in the 82nd percentile, reflecting a strong engagement of the working-age population in the labour market. Earnings growth over the past year has been 8.65%, ranking in the 92nd percentile, which may be influenced by a competitive job market and potentially higher productivity.

In the housing sector, the data shows a slight decline in home prices, with the Home Price Index down 0.54% year-over-year, and a modest decrease in the price-to-rent ratio of -0.15%. These figures, combined with an average of 56 days on the market for properties, suggest a cooling but still active real estate market. Construction activity appears to be increasing, with building permits up 14.29% year-over-year, placing the region in the 76th percentile. This could indicate ongoing investment in residential and commercial development. The overall weighted percentile score of 58.7 and a grade of B suggest that Seattle's economy is performing at an average level compared to other metropolitan areas.

The data collectively indicates that Seattle's economy is performing at a generally stable but not exceptional level across various indicators.
