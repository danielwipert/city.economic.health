# Seattle — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metropolitan area economic data shows a mixed picture. The unemployment rate is 5.1%, placing it in the 8th percentile nationally. This suggests that employment conditions are not among the strongest, but still within a reasonable range. The labour force participation rate is 68.65%, ranking in the 86th percentile, indicating a high level of engagement among the working-age population in the labour market. Earnings growth year-over-year is 9.53%, placing it in the 92nd percentile, which may reflect a competitive job market.

In the housing sector, the year-over-year change in home prices has declined by 0.39%, placing it in the 18th percentile. This suggests a cooling trend in the real estate market. However, the number of building permits issued has increased by 2.65% year-over-year, ranking in the 62nd percentile, which could indicate ongoing investment in residential construction. The average days on market for homes is 67 days, a figure that is neither exceptionally high nor low, placing it in the 46th percentile.

The data indicates that Seattle's economy is performing within a middle range, with some strengths in labour market participation and earnings growth, but with some moderation in the housing market.
