# Houston — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Houston-Pasadena-The Woodlands metropolitan area ranks fifth in economic performance, with a weighted percentile score of 50.9, placing it in the average category. The unemployment rate is 4.8%, a relatively low rate that suggests a stable labour market. The labour force participation rate of 64.74% indicates that a significant portion of the working-age population remains engaged in the labour market. Year-over-year earnings growth of 5.93% exceeds inflation, which stands at 4.32%, suggesting real wage gains. However, the cost of living remains a factor.

Housing market indicators present a mixed picture. Home prices have increased by 8.48% year-over-year, while the number of days on the market has risen to 57 days, suggesting a slight cooling in sales pace. Building permits have declined by 6.1% year-over-year, which may reflect a slowdown in new construction activity. The office vacancy rate has increased by 1.9% year-over-year, potentially signalling a softening demand for commercial space. Weekly hours worked remain high at 36.8 hours, consistent with a strong labour market.

The data suggests a balanced economic environment in Houston, with stable employment, moderate wage growth and mixed housing market conditions.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The Houston-Pasadena-The Woodlands metropolitan area ranks fifth in its economic performance, with a weighted percentile score of 50.9, placing it in the average category. The unemployment rate stands at 4.8%, which is relatively low, suggesting a stable labor market. The labor force participation rate of 64.74% is moderate, indicating that a significant portion of the working-age population remains engaged in the labor market. Year-over-year earnings growth of 5.93% is robust, outpacing inflation, which stands at 4.32%. This suggests that workers are experiencing real wage gains, although the cost of living remains a factor.

Housing market indicators present a mixed picture. The year-over-year increase in home prices of 8.48% indicates a continued appreciation in property values, while the number of days on the market has increased to 57 days, suggesting a slight cooling in the pace of sales. Building permits have declined by 6.1% year-over-year, which may reflect a slowdown in new construction activity. The office vacancy rate has slightly increased, with a year-over-year change of -1.9%, potentially signaling a softening demand for commercial space. Weekly hours worked remain high at 36.8 hours, which is consistent with a strong labor market.

Overall, the data suggests a balanced but not overly dynamic economic environment in Houston, with stable employment, moderate wage growth, and mixed housing market conditions.
