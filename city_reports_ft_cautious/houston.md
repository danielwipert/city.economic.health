# Houston — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Houston's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 5.0%, placing it in the 16th percentile among comparable metropolitan areas. This suggests a relatively higher unemployment level compared to peers. The labor force participation rate of 64.31% is more in line with national averages, indicating that a significant portion of the working-age population remains engaged in the labor market. Earnings growth over the past year has been 5.93%, placing Houston in the 78th percentile. This suggests that those employed are experiencing notable wage gains. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living increase of 4.32%, is moderate and aligns with broader national trends.

The housing market in Houston shows signs of both stability and softening. The year-over-year increase in home prices of 8.48% is solid, placing the city in the 56th percentile. This may reflect continued demand for housing despite economic headwinds. However, the decline in building permits by 6.1% year-over-year, placing it in the 40th percentile, could indicate a slowdown in new construction activity. The average number of days on the market for homes is 57 days, which is in the 48th percentile. This suggests a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a significant advantage. Weekly hours worked, at 36.8 hours, are among the highest in the nation, placing Houston in the 98th percentile.

Overall, Houston's economic performance appears to be stable but not exceptional, with some indicators pointing to areas of strength and others to potential vulnerabilities.
