# Houston — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Houston's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and concern. The unemployment rate of 4.5% places the city in the 28th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively tight labour market. The labour force participation rate of 64.89% is near the national average, suggesting a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth of 6.04% puts Houston in the 64th percentile, a steady increase in wages that may be influenced by broader economic trends.

In the housing market, the year-over-year home price index growth of 8.48% is in the 56th percentile, indicating a moderate appreciation in property values. However, the decline in building permits by 4.81% year-over-year, in the 42nd percentile, may suggest a slowdown in new construction activity. The days on market metric of 64 days is in the 54th percentile, indicating a balanced market. The overall weighted percentile score of 51% and a grade of B suggest an economy performing at an average level, with no clear signs of overheating or significant distress.

These data points suggest a stable economic environment in Houston, with no clear indication of exceptional growth or significant weakness.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Houston's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and concern. The unemployment rate stands at 4.5%, placing it in the 28th percentile nationally, which suggests a relatively tight labor market but not one that is exceptionally robust. The labor force participation rate of 64.89% is near the national average, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth of 6.04% places Houston in the 64th percentile, suggesting a steady increase in wages, though this may reflect broader economic trends rather than local factors alone.

In the housing market, the year-over-year home price index growth of 8.48% is in the 56th percentile, indicating a moderate appreciation in property values. However, the decline in building permits by 4.81% year-over-year, in the 42nd percentile, may reflect a slowdown in new construction activity. The days on market metric of 64 days is in the 54th percentile, suggesting a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a significant advantage. The overall weighted percentile score of 51% and a grade of B further indicate an economy that is performing at an average level, with no clear signs of overheating or significant distress.

These data points suggest a stable but not particularly dynamic economic environment in Houston.
