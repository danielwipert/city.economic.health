# Houston — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Houston's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and challenges. The unemployment rate stands at 4.8%, placing it in the 18th percentile, indicating a relatively low level of joblessness compared to other metropolitan areas. The labour force participation rate of 64.74% is at the 56th percentile, suggesting a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Earnings growth over the past year has been 5.93%, placing it in the 78th percentile, a strong performance that may be associated with a healthy job market. However, the cost of living has also risen by 4.32%, which is in the 74th percentile, suggesting that wage gains are being partially offset by higher living expenses. Average weekly hours worked are 36.8, ranking in the 98th percentile, which could indicate strong labour demand or a tight labour market.

In the housing sector, the year-over-year increase in home prices of 8.48% is in the 56th percentile, indicating a steady but not rapid appreciation. The number of days a property remains on the market has stabilised at 57 days, which is in the 48th percentile, suggesting a balanced market with neither a significant surplus nor shortage of housing. Building permits have decreased by 6.1% year-over-year, placing the metric in the 40th percentile, which may reflect a slowdown in new construction. The vacancy rate for single-family homes has decreased by 1.9%, in the 26th percentile, indicating a tightening rental market. Overall, Houston's weighted percentile score of 50.9 and a grade of "B" suggest an average economic performance, with some positive trends in employment and earnings, but also challenges in housing and cost of living.

These data points indicate a generally stable economic environment in Houston, with some variation in different areas.
