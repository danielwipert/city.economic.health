# Houston — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Houston-Pasadena-The Woodlands metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate of 4.8% places it in the 18th percentile among comparable regions, indicating a tighter labour market than many other areas but still facing challenges. The labour force participation rate of 64.74% ranks in the 56th percentile, suggesting a moderate level of workforce engagement.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 6.04%, positioning Houston in the 64th percentile. This may reflect a stable economic environment for employed individuals. However, the cost of living increase of 4.29% and the decline in weekly hours worked to 37.2 hours, both in the higher percentiles (76th and 98th respectively), suggest that the purchasing power of these earnings may be constrained.

Housing market indicators show a year-over-year increase in home prices of 8.48%, in the 56th percentile, alongside a decrease in building permits of -6.1%, in the 40th percentile, and a slight decline in single-family home sales of -1.9%, in the 26th percentile. These figures indicate a housing market with price appreciation but moderating construction activity and sales.

The weighted percentile score of 49.7 and the grade of B- suggest that Houston's economy is performing below average compared to other metropolitan areas. Strengths in employment and earnings growth are offset by challenges in the labour market and housing sector.
