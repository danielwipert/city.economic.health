# Houston — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Houston's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and concern. The unemployment rate stands at 4.5%, placing it in the 28th percentile among comparable metropolitan areas. This suggests a relatively tight labor market. The labor force participation rate of 64.89% ranks in the 54th percentile, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth of 2.61% is positioned in the 40th percentile, suggesting modest wage increases that may reflect broader economic conditions.

In the housing sector, the year-over-year increase in home prices of 8.48% places Houston in the 56th percentile. This indicates a steady appreciation in home prices. However, the decline in building permits by 14.81% year-over-year, in the 28th percentile, may suggest a slowdown in construction activity. The decrease in the price-to-square-foot ratio by 2.29%, in the 22nd percentile, could indicate a softening in the real estate market, though this is not definitive. The average days on market for homes is 64 days, which is in the 54th percentile, suggesting a balanced market.

Overall, Houston's economic performance appears to be stable, with some indicators suggesting caution.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Houston's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and concern. The unemployment rate stands at 4.5%, placing it in the 28th percentile among comparable metropolitan areas, which suggests a relatively tight labor market but not one that is exceptionally robust. The labor force participation rate of 64.89% is more favorable, ranking in the 54th percentile, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth of 2.61% is positioned in the 40th percentile, suggesting modest wage increases that may reflect broader economic conditions rather than exceptional performance.

In the housing sector, the year-over-year increase in home prices of 8.48% places Houston in the 56th percentile, indicating a steady appreciation that is neither particularly rapid nor sluggish. However, the decline in building permits by 14.81% year-over-year, in the 28th percentile, may reflect a slowdown in construction activity. The decrease in the price-to-square-foot ratio by 2.29%, in the 22nd percentile, could indicate a softening in the real estate market, though this is not definitive. Additionally, the average days on market for homes is 64 days, which is in the 54th percentile, suggesting a balanced market with neither an excess of supply nor demand.

Overall, Houston's economic performance appears to be stable but not outstanding, with some indicators suggesting caution.
