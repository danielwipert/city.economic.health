The unemployment rate is 4.0%, placing it in the 34th percentile nationally. This suggests a labour market that is neither particularly strong nor weak compared to other regions.

The labour force participation rate is 69.03%, ranking in the 88th percentile. This indicates a high level of engagement of the working-age population in the labour market. Earnings growth over the past year has been 3.0%, placing the metro area in the 10th percentile. This may reflect a slower pace of wage increases relative to other areas.

The median days on market for homes is 63 days, which is in the 66th percentile. This indicates a relatively balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a significant advantage.

The data collectively suggests a metropolitan area with a stable economic environment.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington metropolitan area ranks 16th among major U.S. metros, with a weighted percentile score of 38.9, corresponding to a grade of C+. The unemployment rate stands at 4.0%, placing it in the 34th percentile nationally, which suggests a labor market that is neither particularly strong nor weak compared to other regions. The labor force participation rate of 69.03% is notably high, ranking in the 88th percentile, indicating a robust engagement of the working-age population in the labor market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been modest, at 3.0%, placing the metro area in the 10th percentile, which may reflect a slower pace of wage increases relative to other areas. The cost of living index of 7.28 and the overall well-being ratio of 2.56 both fall in the lower percentiles (10th and 54th, respectively), suggesting that while the cost of living is relatively low, the overall quality of life metrics are mixed. Housing market indicators show a year-over-year increase in home prices of 2.87%, and a decline in single-family housing permits of 7.67%, which may reflect a moderating demand for new housing. The median days on market for homes is 63 days, which is in the 66th percentile, indicating a relatively balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a significant advantage.

These data points collectively suggest a metropolitan area with a stable but not particularly dynamic economic environment.
