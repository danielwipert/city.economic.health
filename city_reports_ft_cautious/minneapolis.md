# Minneapolis — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington metropolitan area ranks 16th among US metros, with an overall grade of B, indicating average performance across key economic indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 4.1%, placing it in the 62nd percentile, which suggests a labour market performing slightly above the national median. The labour force participation rate of 69.39% is high, ranking in the 88th percentile, indicating a high level of engagement of the working-age population in the labour market.

Earnings growth year-over-year is at 2.74%, placing the metro in the 38th percentile, which reflects moderate wage pressures or economic conditions. The cost of living index of 4.99 is at the median, suggesting that living costs are in line with the national average. Housing market indicators show a mixed picture: the housing price index has increased by 2.37% year-over-year, placing it in the 30th percentile, while the number of building permits has declined by 5.7% year-over-year, in the 42nd percentile. The decline in permits may indicate a slowdown in new construction activity. The days on market metric stands at 45 days, in the 74th percentile, suggesting a relatively active real estate market where properties are selling faster than the national average.

The data suggests a stable economic environment in Minneapolis, with some strengths in labour market participation and housing market liquidity, and more moderate performance in earnings growth and new construction.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington metropolitan area ranks 16th among US metros, with an overall grade of B, indicating average performance across key economic indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 4.1%, placing it in the 62nd percentile, which suggests a labor market that is performing slightly above the national median. The labor force participation rate of 69.39% is notably high, ranking in the 88th percentile, indicating a robust engagement of the working-age population in the labor market.

Earnings growth year-over-year is at 2.74%, placing the metro in the 38th percentile, which may reflect moderate wage pressures or economic conditions. The cost of living index of 4.99 is at the median, suggesting that living costs are in line with the national average. Housing market indicators show a mixed picture: the housing price index has increased by 2.37% year-over-year, placing it in the 30th percentile, while the number of building permits has declined by 5.7% year-over-year, in the 42nd percentile. This decline in permits may indicate a slowdown in new construction activity. The days on market metric stands at 45 days, in the 74th percentile, suggesting a relatively active real estate market where properties are selling faster than the national average.

Overall, the data suggests a stable but not particularly dynamic economic environment in Minneapolis, with strengths in labor market participation and housing market liquidity, balanced against more moderate performance in earnings growth and new construction.
