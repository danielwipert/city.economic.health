## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington metropolitan area ranks 16th among major U.S. metros, with a weighted percentile score of 44.7, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, which is relatively low and aligns with broader national trends. However, the labor force participation rate of 69.25% is notably high, ranking in the 88th percentile, suggesting a robust engagement of the workforce in the local economy.

Earnings growth over the past year has been modest, increasing by 3%, while the cost of living index is 7.27, indicating a slight rise in living costs. Housing market indicators show a mixed picture: home prices have increased by 2.87% year-over-year, but single-family housing permits have declined by 7.67%, which may reflect a slowdown in new construction. The median days on market for homes is 58 days, a figure that is neither particularly high nor low compared to historical standards.

Overall, the data suggests a stable but not overly dynamic economic environment in Minneapolis, with strong labor force participation offsetting moderate earnings growth and a cautious housing market.
