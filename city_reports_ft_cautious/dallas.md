# Dallas — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metropolitan area received a grade of B in a recent economic assessment, indicating average performance relative to other regions. The unemployment rate is 4.0%, placing it near the median among metropolitan areas. This may suggest a stable labour market, but one that is not particularly robust.

The labour force participation rate of 70.08% is high, ranking in the 90th percentile. This indicates a strong engagement of the working-age population in the labour market. Earnings growth over the past year has been 3.1%, which aligns with the 44th percentile. The cost of living index of 4.93 is slightly above the national average, placing it in the 52nd percentile.

In the housing sector, the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metro area has seen declines in both home prices and permits issued, with year-over-year decreases of 1.39% and 9.74%, respectively. These figures place the region in the lower percentiles (4th and 32nd) for these indicators. The days on market metric stands at 71 days, which is relatively low and suggests that homes are still selling at a steady pace. Weekly hours worked have remained stable at 35.5 hours, a figure that ranks in the 92nd percentile, indicating consistent employment conditions.

The data suggests a mixed economic environment in Dallas, with some strengths and more moderate performance in other areas.
