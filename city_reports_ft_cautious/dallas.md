## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metropolitan area ranks fourth in the dataset, with an overall weighted percentile score of 53.9, corresponding to a grade of B, described as "Average." The unemployment rate stands at 4.2%, placing it in the 38th percentile, which suggests that the labor market is performing in line with national trends but not exceptionally strong. The labor force participation rate of 69.85% is notably high, ranking in the 90th percentile, indicating a robust engagement of the working-age population in the labor market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 5.9%, placing it in the 62nd percentile, suggesting moderate wage increases. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is at 4.54%, in the 64th percentile, which may reflect broader economic conditions affecting consumer prices. Housing market indicators show a mixed picture: the housing price index has decreased by 1.45% year-over-year, while the permits for new residential buildings have increased by 4.08%, both in the middle range of percentiles (6th and 56th, respectively). This could indicate a slowdown in home price appreciation alongside continued construction activity. The average days on market for homes is 64 days, in the 20th percentile, suggesting a relatively slower pace of home sales compared to other markets.

Overall, the data indicates a stable but not particularly dynamic economic environment in Dallas, with strengths in labor force participation and weekly hours worked, balanced by more moderate performance in other key indicators.
