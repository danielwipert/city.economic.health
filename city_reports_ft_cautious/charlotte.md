# Charlotte — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 3.8%, placing it in the 64th percentile among comparable regions. This suggests a relatively robust labour market. However, the year-over-year change in earnings has declined by 1.15%, indicating a potential softening in wage growth. The labour force participation rate is at 65.51%, also in the 64th percentile, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population remains engaged in the labour market.

In the housing sector, the year-over-year change in home prices has increased by 0.39%, which is in the 26th percentile, reflecting modest appreciation. Building permits have decreased by 15.37% year-over-year, placing the region in the 36th percentile. This may indicate a slowdown in new construction activity. The cost of living index is 1.37 times the national average, ranking in the 86th percentile, highlighting the relatively high cost of living in the area. The days on market for homes is 62 days, in the 30th percentile, suggesting a balanced market.

The weighted percentile score of 46.3 and the grade of B- indicate that Charlotte's economic performance is below average compared to other metropolitan areas. Strengths in labour market engagement and cost of living are evident, but challenges in wage growth and housing market dynamics are also present.
