# Charlotte — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate is 4.2%, placing it at the 42nd percentile nationally, indicating a labour market that is neither particularly strong nor weak compared to other regions. The labour force participation rate is 65.3%, slightly above average, suggesting a relatively engaged workforce. However, earnings growth has been negative over the past year, declining by 1.52%.

Housing market indicators show a nuanced picture. The housing price index has increased by 0.34% year-over-year, a modest gain that places the region at the 22nd percentile, suggesting stable but not robust growth in home values. Building permits have declined by 22.8% year-over-year, a significant drop that could indicate reduced construction activity or a shift in development priorities. The number of days properties remain on the market has risen to 72 days, up from previous levels, which may reflect a cooling in buyer demand or an adjustment in seller expectations.

The data suggests that Charlotte's economy is experiencing a period of moderate stability with some areas of concern.
