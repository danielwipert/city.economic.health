# Charlotte — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia metropolitan area has a weighted percentile score of 38.9 in a recent economic assessment, corresponding to a grade of C+. This places it 21st in the rankings.

The area's unemployment rate stands at 4.1%, which is at the 62nd percentile. This suggests a relatively stable labour market, but one that is not particularly robust compared with other regions. The labour force participation rate is 64.69%, at the median, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 1.59%, ranking in the 16th percentile. This may reflect a slower pace of wage increases compared with other areas. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is 5.36%, placing it in the 26th percentile. This suggests that prices are rising, but at a rate that is not among the highest nationally.

Housing market indicators show a mixed picture. Home prices have increased by 0.73% year-over-year, placing them in the 28th percentile. Building permits have declined by 15.37%, ranking in the 36th percentile. This may indicate a slowdown in construction activity.

The data suggests a region with moderate economic performance, characterised by stable but not strong labour market conditions and modest growth in earnings and housing prices.
