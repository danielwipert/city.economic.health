# Atlanta — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell metropolitan area ranks eighth in the dataset, with an overall weighted percentile score of 57.7, placing it in the average range with a grade of B. The unemployment rate is 3.9%, a relatively low figure, indicating a stable labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 64.36% is below the median, suggesting that a portion of the working-age population remains outside the labour force.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 9.99%, placing this metric in the 94th percentile. This suggests strong wage pressures or improvements in worker productivity. Inflationary pressures appear moderate, with a cost of living increase of 4.22% and an overall wage rate increase of 3.46%. These figures are above the median but do not indicate runaway inflation.

The housing market shows mixed signals: building permits have declined by 6.61% year-over-year, and the home price index has decreased by 0.11%. The days on market for properties have increased to 70 days, which may reflect a more balanced buyer-seller dynamic. Overall, the data suggests a region with a stable economic environment, characterised by a mix of positive and negative trends.
