# Atlanta — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Atlanta's economic data presents a mixed picture, with some indicators showing strength and others pointing to areas of concern. The metropolitan area's unemployment rate stands at 3.4%, placing it in the 80th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively robust labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 64.51% ranks in the 46th percentile, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population remains outside the labour force. Earnings growth over the past year has been solid at 6.24%, also in the 80th percentile, indicating that those employed are experiencing wage increases. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is at 4.66%, which is in line with broader national trends and places Atlanta in the 60th percentile.

On the housing front, the data suggests a cooling market. Housing prices have decreased slightly by 0.11% year-over-year, and the number of building permits has declined by 20.77%, both placing Atlanta in the lower percentiles (20th and 26th, respectively). This may reflect a slowdown in construction activity and a softening in demand for new homes. The average days on market for properties is 61 days, which is in the 32nd percentile, suggesting a moderate pace of sales. The overall weighted score of 54 and a grade of "B" indicate that Atlanta's economy is performing at an average level compared to other metropolitan areas.

Atlanta's economic landscape is characterised by a strong labour market and wage growth, but these positive aspects are balanced by signs of a cooling housing market.

The economic data for the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell metropolitan area presents a mixed picture, with some indicators showing strength while others point to areas of concern. The unemployment rate stands at 3.4%, placing it in the 80th percentile nationally, which suggests a relatively robust labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 64.51% is more modest, ranking in the 46th percentile, indicating that a significant portion of the working-age population remains outside the labor force. Earnings growth over the past year has been solid at 6.24%, also in the 80th percentile, suggesting that those employed are experiencing wage increases. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is at 4.66%, which is in line with broader national trends and places Atlanta in the 60th percentile.

On the housing front, the data reveals a cooling market. Housing prices have decreased slightly by 0.11% year-over-year, and the number of building permits has declined by 20.77%, both placing Atlanta in the lower percentiles (20th and 26th, respectively). This may reflect a slowdown in construction activity and a softening in demand for new homes. The average days on market for properties is 61 days, which, while not exceptionally high, is still in the 32nd percentile, suggesting a moderate pace of sales. The overall weighted score of 54 and a grade of "B" indicate that Atlanta's economy is performing at an average level compared to other metropolitan areas.

In summary, Atlanta's economic landscape is characterized by a strong labor market and wage growth, but these positive aspects are balanced by signs of a cooling housing market.
