## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell metropolitan area ranks eighth in the dataset, with an overall weighted percentile score of 54.1, placing it in the average range according to the grading system provided. The unemployment rate stands at 3.4%, which is relatively low and places the region in the 80th percentile for this indicator.

Year-over-year earnings growth is strong at 6.24%, also in the 80th percentile, indicating that workers are experiencing significant wage increases.

Housing market indicators present a mixed picture. The year-over-year change in housing prices is slightly negative at -0.16%, and the number of building permits has declined by 20.77% compared to the previous year, both placing these metrics in lower percentiles (22nd and 26th, respectively). This may reflect a cooling in the housing market. Additionally, the days on market for properties have increased to 61 days, suggesting a slowdown in sales activity.

Overall, the data indicates a mixed but generally stable economic environment in Atlanta, with strengths in employment and earnings offset by some weakening in the housing sector.
