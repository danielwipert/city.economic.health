# Atlanta — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell metropolitan area ranks 8th among major U.S. metros, with a weighted percentile score of 54.3, placing it in the "Average" category. The unemployment rate is 3.5%, which is relatively low and ranks in the 86th percentile. This suggests a labour market that is performing well. However, the labour force participation rate of 64.14% is more moderate, ranking in the 44th percentile, indicating that a significant portion of the population remains outside the labour force.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 6.47%, placing the metro in the 80th percentile. This suggests a healthy increase in income levels. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is 4.59%, which is in line with broader national trends and ranks in the 70th percentile. Housing market indicators show a mixed picture: the housing price index has declined by 0.16% year-over-year, and the number of building permits has fallen by 20.77%. These indicators rank in the 22nd and 26th percentiles, respectively. The days on market remain at 60 days, suggesting that properties are still finding buyers, albeit at a slower pace.

Atlanta's economic indicators suggest a balanced performance across various sectors, with no clear standout areas.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Roswell metropolitan area ranks 8th among major U.S. metros, with a weighted percentile score of 54.3, placing it in the "Average" category. The unemployment rate stands at 3.5%, which is relatively low and places the metro in the 86th percentile, suggesting a robust labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 64.14% is more moderate, ranking in the 44th percentile, indicating that while employment is strong, a significant portion of the population remains outside the labor force.

Earnings growth over the past year has been positive at 6.47%, placing the metro in the 80th percentile, which suggests a healthy increase in income levels. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is at 4.59%, which is in line with broader national trends and ranks in the 70th percentile. Housing market indicators show a mixed picture: the housing price index has declined slightly by 0.16% year-over-year, and the number of building permits has fallen by 20.77%, both placing the metro in lower percentiles (22nd and 26th, respectively). This may reflect a cooling in the housing market, though the days on market remain at a moderate 60 days, suggesting that while sales activity has slowed, properties are still finding buyers.

Overall, Atlanta's economic indicators suggest a balanced but not exceptional performance across various sectors.
