# Nashville — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin metropolitan area presents a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 3.1%, placing it in the 94th percentile nationally, indicating a strong labour market. The labour force participation rate of 75.77% further supports this, ranking in the 98th percentile, suggesting a high level of engagement in the workforce.

However, earnings growth year-over-year is modest at 2.8%, placing it in the 34th percentile, indicating that while employment is strong, wage increases are relatively moderate. Housing market indicators show a dynamic environment, with the housing price index increasing by 10.55% year-over-year, reflecting continued demand in the real estate sector. This growth is in the 56th percentile, suggesting it is not among the fastest-growing markets.

Building permits have risen by 22.78% year-over-year, a notable increase that may reflect ongoing development and construction activity. The supply of homes for sale has decreased by 0.38% year-over-year, and properties are taking an average of 61 days to sell, which is relatively quick and places this metric in the 22nd percentile, indicating a competitive market for buyers.

The data suggests that Nashville's economy is performing above average, with strong labour market indicators and active housing dynamics. However, wage growth and housing supply remain areas of potential concern.
