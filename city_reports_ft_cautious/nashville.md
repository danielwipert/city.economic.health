# Nashville — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin metropolitan area's economic data shows a mixed performance across various indicators. The unemployment rate is 3.2%, placing it in the 90th percentile nationally, indicating a strong labor market. The labor force participation rate is 76.17%, ranking in the 98th percentile, suggesting high engagement among the working-age population. However, earnings growth year-over-year is 4.05%, which is in the 40th percentile, possibly reflecting moderate wage pressures or a stabilizing trend in income growth.

Housing market indicators present a more complex picture. The housing price index has increased by 7.88% year-over-year, indicating continued appreciation in property values, albeit at a pace that is in the 54th percentile. Building permits have declined by 6.96% year-over-year, which may suggest a slowdown in new construction activity. The median days on market for properties is 71 days, a figure that is within a range suggesting a balanced buyer-seller environment.

The data suggests that Nashville's economy is performing above average, with strong labor market metrics offset by more moderate indicators in earnings growth and housing construction.
