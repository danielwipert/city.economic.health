## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin metropolitan area presents a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate is 3.2%, placing it in the 90th percentile nationally, indicating a strong labour market. The labour force participation rate is 76.17%, ranking in the 98th percentile, suggesting high engagement in the workforce.

However, earnings growth year-over-year is 4.05%, placing it in the 40th percentile, indicating moderate wage increases relative to other regions. Housing market indicators show a more nuanced picture. The home price index has increased by 7.88% year-over-year, placing it in the 54th percentile, which may reflect steady demand for housing.

In contrast, building permits have declined by 2.88% year-over-year, ranking in the 48th percentile, potentially indicating a slowdown in new construction activity. The days on market metric stands at 71 days, in the 28th percentile, suggesting that properties are taking longer to sell compared to many other markets.

The data suggests that while Nashville's labour market remains strong, there are signs of moderation in both wage growth and housing market dynamics.
