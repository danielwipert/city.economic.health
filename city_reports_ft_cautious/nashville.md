# Nashville — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin metropolitan area's economic data shows a mixed picture across several key indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 3.0%, placing it in the 90th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively strong labor market. The labor force participation rate of 76.27% is also in the 98th percentile, suggesting high engagement among the working-age population. However, earnings growth year-over-year is 1.62%, which ranks in the 30th percentile, possibly reflecting broader economic conditions or local factors.

Housing market indicators present a more complex picture. The housing price index has increased by 7.88% year-over-year, suggesting continued demand for residential properties. However, the number of building permits has declined by 6.96% over the same period, which could indicate a slowdown in new construction or a shift in development priorities. The days-on-market metric is 71 days, in the 42nd percentile, suggesting a balanced market. The cost of living index is 5.78% above the national average, and the overall wage rate is 3.9% higher than the national average, both of which are in the 22nd and 92nd percentiles, respectively, indicating varying pressures on household budgets.

The data suggests that Nashville's economy is performing above average, with strong labor market indicators and moderate housing market activity.
