# Nashville — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Nashville-Davidson–Murfreesboro–Franklin metropolitan area presents a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 3.1%, ranking in the 92nd percentile nationally, indicating a relatively strong labor market. The labor force participation rate of 76.06% further supports this, ranking in the 98th percentile, suggesting a high level of engagement in the workforce.

However, earnings growth year-over-year is at 4.05%, placing it in the 40th percentile, which may reflect moderate wage pressures or a stabilizing trend in income growth. 

Housing market indicators show both positive and cautionary signs. The housing price index has increased by 7.88% year-over-year, placing it in the 54th percentile, indicating steady appreciation in home values. In contrast, the number of permits issued for new residential construction has risen by 22.78% year-over-year, a notable increase that places it in the 84th percentile, suggesting continued investment in the housing sector. The days on market metric stands at 63 days, in the 26th percentile, which could indicate a balanced market with neither a surplus nor a shortage of available properties.

The data suggests that Nashville's economy is performing above average, with strong labor market conditions and steady housing market activity, though wage growth appears more moderate.
