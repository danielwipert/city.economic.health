# Pittsburgh — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Pittsburgh's economic data presents a mixed picture, with various indicators showing both positive and negative trends. The unemployment rate of 3.6% places the city in the 74th percentile among comparable regions, suggesting a relatively strong labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.61% ranks in the 14th percentile, indicating a lower engagement of the working-age population in the labor market compared to other areas.

Earnings growth year-over-year is 8.65%, ranking in the 96th percentile, which may be influenced by a tightening labor market or shifts in industry composition. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is at 4.17%, slightly above the national average. Wage growth appears to be outpacing inflation, potentially benefiting workers.

The housing market shows a complex trend. The housing price index has increased by 15.05% year-over-year, placing Pittsburgh in the 76th percentile, suggesting strong demand for housing. However, the number of building permits has declined by 18.72% year-over-year, ranking in the 20th percentile, which may indicate a slowdown in new construction or a shift in housing market priorities. The days on market metric stands at 71 days, in the 28th percentile, indicating a moderate pace of home sales.

Overall, Pittsburgh's economic performance is characterized by average outcomes, with some strengths in earnings growth and housing prices, but also challenges in labor force participation and new construction activity.
