# Pittsburgh — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Pittsburgh's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The city's unemployment rate is 4.7%, placing it in the 24th percentile nationally. This suggests a relatively tight labour market, but one that lags behind many other metropolitan areas. The labour force participation rate is 60.7%, positioning the city in the 20th percentile. This indicates a moderate level of engagement in the workforce.

Earnings growth year-over-year is 4.92%, ranking in the 60th percentile. This suggests some improvement in income levels for those employed. Housing market dynamics show contrasting trends. The year-over-year increase in home prices is 16.85%, placing Pittsburgh in the 78th percentile. However, the decline in building permits by 24.33% year-over-year, situated in the 20th percentile, indicates a slowdown in new construction activity.

The cost of living has increased by 4.34%, ranking in the 80th percentile. The overall wage replacement ratio is 3.38%, also in the 80th percentile. This suggests that while incomes are growing, so too are living costs. The average number of days on the market for homes is 53, in the 52nd percentile. This indicates a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a significant advantage.

Pittsburgh's economic performance, as reflected in these indicators, appears to be below average. Strengths in earnings growth and housing appreciation are offset by challenges in employment and cost of living.
