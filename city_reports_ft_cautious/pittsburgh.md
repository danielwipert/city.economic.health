# Pittsburgh — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Pittsburgh's economic data presents a mixed picture, with some indicators showing strength and others suggesting areas of concern. The unemployment rate stands at 3.6%, placing it in the 74th percentile among comparable regions, indicating a relatively robust labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 60.61% is in the 14th percentile, suggesting a lower engagement of the working-age population in the labour market compared to other areas.

Earnings growth year-over-year is 8.36%, ranking in the 86th percentile, which may reflect improvements in wage conditions or shifts in the composition of employment. In the housing sector, the annual increase in home prices of 15.05% places Pittsburgh in the 76th percentile, suggesting a continued appreciation in property values. However, the decline in building permits by 21.36% year-over-year, in the 22nd percentile, indicates a slowdown in new construction activity.

The cost of living index of 4.18, in the 82nd percentile, and the owner-occupied housing costs of 3.26, in the 76th percentile, both suggest that living expenses are relatively high compared to other regions. Weekly hours worked average 34.2 hours, in the 40th percentile, which is moderate and may reflect a balance between full-time and part-time employment.

Pittsburgh's economic performance appears to be average, with some strengths in earnings growth and housing price appreciation, but also challenges in labour force participation and new construction activity.
