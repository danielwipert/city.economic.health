# Pittsburgh — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Pittsburgh's economic data presents a mixed picture, with both positive and negative trends evident. The city's unemployment rate is 3.6%, placing it at the 50th percentile nationally, indicating a labour market that is neither particularly tight nor slack. The labour force participation rate is 60.33%, ranking in the 10th percentile, suggesting a relatively low engagement of the working-age population in the labour market. Earnings growth year-over-year is 8.65%, positioning Pittsburgh in the 96th percentile, which may reflect strong wage pressures or productivity improvements.

The housing market in Pittsburgh shows contrasting trends. Home prices have increased by 15.05% year-over-year, placing the city in the 76th percentile, suggesting a relatively strong housing market. However, building permits have declined by 18.72% year-over-year, placing the city in the 20th percentile, which could indicate a slowdown in new construction activity. The cost of living index is 4.17, and the overall wage index is 3.38, both of which are above the national median, placing them in the 76th and 80th percentiles respectively, indicating relatively higher costs and wages compared to other metropolitan areas.

Pittsburgh's economic performance, as reflected in these indicators, appears to be average, with some strengths and weaknesses evident.

Pittsburgh's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and concern. The unemployment rate stands at 3.6%, placing it at the 50th percentile nationally, which suggests a labor market that is neither particularly tight nor slack.

Housing market dynamics show contrasting trends. The year-over-year increase in home prices is 15.05%, situating the city in the 76th percentile, suggesting a relatively strong housing market. However, building permits have declined by 18.72% year-over-year, placing the city in the 20th percentile, which could indicate a slowdown in new construction activity.
