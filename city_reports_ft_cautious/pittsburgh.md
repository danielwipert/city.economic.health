# Pittsburgh — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Pittsburgh's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.7%, placing it in the 24th percentile nationally. This suggests a relatively tight labour market, but one that lags behind many other metropolitan areas. The labour force participation rate of 60.7% is below the national median, indicating a moderate level of workforce engagement.

Earnings growth year-over-year is 4.92%, ranking in the 60th percentile. This may reflect a strengthening job market with better compensation for workers. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is 4.34%, placing it in the 80th percentile. This suggests that living costs are rising faster than in most other regions.

Housing dynamics in Pittsburgh show contrasting trends. The housing price index has increased by 15.05% year-over-year, placing the city in the 76th percentile. However, building permits have declined by 24.33% over the same period, ranking in the 20th percentile. The days on market metric is 53 days, near the median, suggesting a balanced market.

Overall, Pittsburgh's economic indicators suggest a region with moderate growth, some areas of strength and others of concern.
