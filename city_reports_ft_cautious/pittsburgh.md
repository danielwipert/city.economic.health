# Pittsburgh — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Pittsburgh's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and challenges. The city's unemployment rate stands at 3.9%, slightly above the national average, placing it in the 54th percentile among metropolitan areas. This suggests a labor market performing at an average level. The labor force participation rate of 60.25% is lower, ranking in the 8th percentile, indicating relatively low engagement of the working-age population in the labor market. Earnings growth over the past year has been 5.7%, placing Pittsburgh in the 76th percentile, a favorable sign for wage earners. The cost of living index, at 4.29, and the overall well-being rank, at 3.28, both place in the 76th and 82nd percentiles, respectively, suggesting living costs and overall quality of life are relatively moderate.

Housing market dynamics show a complex pattern. The year-over-year increase in the housing price index of 15.05% places Pittsburgh in the 76th percentile, indicating a strong appreciation in home values. However, the year-over-year decline in building permits by 24.33% and the 4.1% increase in the supply of for-sale homes suggest a slowdown in new construction and a potential easing in the housing market. The average days on market for properties is 58 days, in the 42nd percentile, indicating a moderate pace of sales. These figures may reflect a balancing act between demand and supply in the housing sector.

Pittsburgh's economic performance, as measured by a weighted percentile of 54.3 and a grade of "B," suggests an average economic environment with some positive trends in earnings and housing values, but with challenges in labor force participation and construction activity. Overall, the city's economic data indicates a balanced but not exceptional performance across key indicators.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Pittsburgh's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and challenges. The city's unemployment rate stands at 3.9%, which is slightly above the national average, placing it in the 54th percentile among metropolitan areas. This suggests a labor market that is performing at an average level, neither particularly robust nor weak. The labor force participation rate of 60.25% is notably lower, ranking in the 8th percentile, indicating a relatively low engagement of the working-age population in the labor market. Earnings growth over the past year has been positive at 5.7%, placing Pittsburgh in the 76th percentile, which is a favorable sign for wage earners. The cost of living index, at 4.29, and the overall well-being rank, at 3.28, both place in the 76th and 82nd percentiles, respectively, suggesting that living costs and overall quality of life are relatively moderate compared to other metropolitan areas.

Housing market dynamics show a more complex pattern. The year-over-year increase in the housing price index of 15.05% places Pittsburgh in the 76th percentile, indicating a strong appreciation in home values. However, the year-over-year decline in building permits by 24.33% and the 4.1% increase in the supply of for-sale homes suggest a slowdown in new construction and a potential easing in the housing market. The average days on market for properties is 58 days, which is in the 42nd percentile, indicating a moderate pace of sales. These figures may reflect a balancing act between demand and supply in the housing sector. Overall, Pittsburgh's economic performance, as measured by a weighted percentile of 54.3 and a grade of "B," suggests an average economic environment with some positive trends in earnings and housing values, but with challenges in labor force participation and construction activity.

In summary, Pittsburgh's economic data indicates a balanced but not exceptional performance across key indicators.
