# Pittsburgh — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Pittsburgh's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some metrics suggesting relative strength while others indicate areas of potential concern. The city's unemployment rate stands at 3.6%, placing it in the 74th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively low level of joblessness. However, the labour force participation rate of 60.61% is in the 14th percentile, suggesting a lower proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labour market compared to other metropolitan areas. Year-over-year earnings growth of 8.36% places Pittsburgh in the 86th percentile, a strong showing that may reflect robust wage increases or shifts towards higher-paying sectors.

In the housing market, the year-over-year increase in home prices of 15.05% positions Pittsburgh in the 76th percentile, suggesting continued appreciation in property values. However, the decline in building permits by 18.72% year-over-year, placing the city in the 20th percentile, indicates a slowdown in new construction activity. The median days on market for homes is 71 days, in the 28th percentile, which may suggest a more balanced market.

The weighted percentile score of 57.6 and a grade of B indicate an average economic performance, with strengths in employment and earnings growth offset by challenges in labour force participation and housing construction. The data points highlight the diverse economic landscape of Pittsburgh, with both positive and cautionary signals.
