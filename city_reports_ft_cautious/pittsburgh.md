# Pittsburgh — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Pittsburgh's economic indicators show a mixed picture, with both positive and negative trends. The unemployment rate stands at 4.7%, placing it in the 24th percentile among comparable metropolitan areas. This suggests a relatively tight labor market, but one that is not exceptionally robust. The labor force participation rate of 60.7% is in the lower quartile, indicating that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labor market.

Earnings growth year-over-year is at 5.7%, ranking in the 76th percentile, which indicates a healthy increase in wages. Cost of living and wage growth relative to the national average are also in the 76th and 82nd percentiles, respectively. This suggests that Pittsburgh residents may be experiencing improved purchasing power.

The housing market presents contrasting trends. The year-over-year change in housing prices is up 15.05%, placing the region in the 76th percentile. This may reflect strong demand or limited supply. However, building permits have declined by 24.33% year-over-year, ranking in the 20th percentile. This could indicate a slowdown in new construction or a shift in development priorities. The days on market metric stands at 58 days, in the 42nd percentile, suggesting a balanced market.

The year-over-year change in professional and business services employment is up 4.1%, ranking in the 92nd percentile. This points to a growing sector that may be contributing positively to the local economy.

Overall, Pittsburgh's economic performance appears to be average, with some strengths and some challenges.
