# Pittsburgh — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Pittsburgh's economic indicators display a mixed profile, reflecting both areas of relative strength and challenges. The unemployment rate stands at 3.9%, slightly above the national average, while the labour force participation rate of 60.25% ranks in the bottom 10th percentile among comparable metropolitan areas. This contrast suggests a complex labour market dynamic, where low unemployment coexists with relatively low workforce engagement.

Earnings growth year-over-year is 5.7%, significantly above the median, and cost of living and wage growth relative to the national average are also strong, each scoring in the 76th percentile. However, the housing market shows signs of cooling, with a 24.33% decline in building permits year-over-year and a 15.05% increase in home prices. The days-on-market metric stands at 58 days, indicating a balanced real estate market.

Pittsburgh's economic performance appears to be average, with strengths in earnings and cost of living offset by challenges in labour force participation and housing construction.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Pittsburgh's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and challenges. The unemployment rate stands at 3.9%, placing it slightly above the national average, while the labor force participation rate of 60.25% is notably lower, ranking in the bottom 10th percentile among comparable metropolitan areas. This contrast suggests a complex labor market dynamic, where low unemployment coexists with relatively low engagement in the workforce.

Earnings growth year-over-year is robust at 5.7%, well above the median, and cost of living and wage growth relative to the national average are also strong, each scoring in the 76th percentile. However, the housing market shows signs of cooling, with a 24.33% decline in building permits year-over-year, and a 15.05% increase in home prices, which, while significant, may reflect a slowing trend compared to previous periods. The days-on-market metric stands at 58 days, indicating a balanced but not overly hot real estate market.

Overall, Pittsburgh's economic performance appears to be average, with strengths in earnings and cost of living offset by challenges in labor force participation and housing construction.
