# Memphis — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Memphis's economic data reveals a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 4.4%, placing it in the 28th percentile among comparable metropolitan areas. This suggests a relatively tight labor market, but not one of the lowest rates observed. The labor force participation rate of 60.64% is in the 16th percentile, indicating a lower level of engagement in the workforce compared to other regions.

Earnings growth year-over-year is 6.95%, ranking in the 84th percentile. This may reflect strong wage pressures or improvements in productivity. Housing market indicators present a more complex picture. The year-over-year change in housing permits has declined by 34.38%, placing Memphis in the 10th percentile. This could signal a slowdown in residential construction activity. Conversely, the home price index has increased by 5.21% year-over-year, in the 44th percentile, suggesting moderate appreciation in property values. The days on market metric stands at 71 days, in the 12th percentile, which might indicate a less dynamic sales environment compared to other markets.

The weighted percentile score of 40.3 and the grade of B- suggest that Memphis's economic performance is below average relative to its peers. The data highlights both strengths and areas for concern in Memphis's economy, without indicating a clear trend or causal relationship.
