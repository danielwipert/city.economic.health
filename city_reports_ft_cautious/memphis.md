# Memphis — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Memphis's economic data, based on the latest available figures, presents a mixed picture. The city's unemployment rate of 4.4% places it in the 28th percentile nationally, suggesting a labour market that is neither particularly strong nor weak compared to other metropolitan areas. The labour force participation rate of 60.64% is below the national median, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Earnings growth over the past year has been 6.95%, placing Memphis in the 84th percentile, a significant improvement relative to other cities. The cost of living has risen by 4.15%, slightly above the national average, and the average weekly hours worked are 34.3, in line with broader national trends.

Housing market indicators show a complex scenario. The year-over-year change in housing prices has increased by 5.21%, placing the city in the 42nd percentile, suggesting moderate growth. However, the number of building permits has declined by 34.38%, a significant drop that places Memphis in the 10th percentile, indicating a slowdown in new construction. The median days on market for properties is 71 days, relatively high and potentially reflecting a less dynamic housing market. The overall weighted percentile score of 40.1 and a grade of B- suggest that Memphis is performing below average compared to other metropolitan areas, with a balance of strengths and weaknesses across various economic indicators.

These data points indicate a city with stable but not robust economic conditions, with notable strengths in earnings growth and some challenges in labour market participation and housing market dynamics.
