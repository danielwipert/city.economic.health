# Memphis — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Memphis's economic data reveals a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 4.6%, placing it in the 32nd percentile among comparable metro areas, indicating a relatively stable labour market. The labour force participation rate of 60.45% is lower than the national average, ranking in the 12th percentile, suggesting potential underutilization of the workforce.

On a more positive note, earnings growth year-over-year is strong at 9.43%, ranking in the 94th percentile, indicating significant wage increases for those employed. Housing market indicators present a contrasting picture. The year-over-year change in housing permits has declined sharply by 34.38%, placing Memphis in the 10th percentile, which may reflect a slowdown in construction activity. The housing price index has increased by 5.21% year-over-year, ranking in the 42nd percentile, suggesting some stability in property values despite the decline in building permits.

The days on market for homes have increased to 68 days, up from previous levels, which could indicate a cooling in the pace of sales. Overall, the data suggests that Memphis's economy experiences both areas of strength, such as earnings growth, and signs of softening in sectors like employment and housing construction.
