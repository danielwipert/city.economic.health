# Memphis — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Memphis's economic data presents a mixed picture across various indicators. The city's unemployment rate stands at 4.4%, placing it in the 28th percentile among comparable metro areas, suggesting a relatively stable but not particularly robust labour market. The labour force participation rate of 60.64% is in the 16th percentile, which may indicate a lower engagement of the working-age population in the labour market compared to other regions.

Earnings growth year-over-year is at 8.34%, ranking in the 84th percentile, suggesting a significant increase in income levels. However, this is somewhat offset by a cost of living index of 4.13, also in the 82nd percentile, indicating that higher earnings may be partially eroded by rising living costs.

In the housing sector, the year-over-year change in housing prices is 5.21%, placing it in the 44th percentile, suggesting moderate appreciation. However, the number of building permits has declined by 34.38% year-over-year, ranking in the 10th percentile, which may indicate a slowdown in new construction activity. Property sales frequency has decreased by 1.88% year-over-year, in the 28th percentile, and the average days on market for properties is 71 days, in the 12th percentile, both of which suggest a less active real estate market.

Weekly hours worked stand at 34.6 hours, in the 58th percentile, indicating a moderate level of work intensity. Overall, the data for Memphis suggests a labour market with stable employment but low participation, alongside strong earnings growth that is tempered by high living costs. The housing market shows moderate price appreciation but faces challenges in new construction and property turnover.
