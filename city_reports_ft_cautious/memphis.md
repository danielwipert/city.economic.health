# Memphis — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Memphis's economic data, as of the latest available figures, presents a mixed picture. The city's unemployment rate stands at 4.4%, placing it in the 34th percentile nationally. This suggests that employment conditions are neither particularly strong nor weak. The labor force participation rate of 60.17% ranks in the 8th percentile, indicating a lower proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labor market compared to other metropolitan areas.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 8.34%, placing Memphis in the 84th percentile. This indicates that those employed are experiencing significant wage gains. However, the cost of living has also risen by 4.12%, which may offset some of the benefits of higher earnings. The housing market shows a year-over-year increase in home prices of 5.21%, but this is accompanied by a decline in housing permits of 32.34%, suggesting a potential slowdown in new construction activity. The number of days properties remain on the market has increased to 78 days, which may reflect a cooling in demand or an oversupply of homes.

Memphis's economic performance, as measured by a weighted score of 36 and a grade of C+, is below average when compared to other metropolitan areas. The city's strengths include earnings growth and a relatively stable cost of living. However, challenges persist in labor force participation and housing market activity.
