The days on market for properties have increased to 71 days, in the 12th percentile, which may reflect a cooling in the housing market or a shift in buyer behaviour. The overall weighted percentile score of 40.1 and a grade of B- suggest that Memphis is performing below average compared to other metropolitan areas, with a balance of strengths and weaknesses across various economic indicators.

These data points suggest a nuanced outlook for Memphis, highlighting areas of both resilience and challenge in the local economy.
