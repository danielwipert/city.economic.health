# Memphis — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Memphis's economic data reveals a mixed picture across various indicators. The city's unemployment rate stands at 4.6%, placing it in the 32nd percentile among comparable metropolitan areas. This may suggest a relatively stable but not robust labor market. The labor force participation rate of 60.45% is in the 12th percentile, indicating lower engagement in the workforce compared to other regions.

Earnings growth year-over-year is at 6.95%, ranking in the 84th percentile, suggesting significant wage increases for those employed. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is at 4.15%, in the 78th percentile, indicating higher living costs relative to income growth.

Housing and construction indicators present a contrasting picture. Building permits have declined by 34.38% year-over-year, placing Memphis in the 10th percentile. This may reflect a slowdown in residential construction activity. However, the housing price index has increased by 5.21% over the same period, in the 42nd percentile, suggesting some resilience in property values despite the decline in new construction. The days on market metric is 71 days, in the 12th percentile, indicating a longer time to sell properties.

Overall, the data suggests a labor market with moderate employment levels and strong wage growth, but with challenges in labor force participation and housing market dynamics.
