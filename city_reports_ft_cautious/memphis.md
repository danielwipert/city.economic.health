# Memphis — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Memphis's economic performance is characterised by a mixed set of indicators. The city's unemployment rate stands at 4.0%, placing it in the 34th percentile among comparable metropolitan areas, suggesting a relatively stable labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 60.48% is in the lower end of the spectrum, at the 18th percentile, which may indicate some challenges in engaging a larger portion of the population in the workforce. On a more positive note, earnings growth year-over-year is at 6.16%, ranking in the 78th percentile, indicating moderate wage increases for those employed.

Housing and construction metrics present a complex picture. The year-over-year change in housing permits has declined by 32.45%, placing Memphis in the 2nd percentile, which may suggest a slowdown in residential construction activity. In contrast, the housing price index has increased by 5.21% year-over-year, in the 44th percentile, indicating some stability in property values. The rental market appears to be under pressure, with a 4.35% decrease in the number of single-family rentals year-over-year, placing the city in the 6th percentile. The average days on market for properties has risen to 81 days, in the 14th percentile, which could suggest a less dynamic real estate market.
