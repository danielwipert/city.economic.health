## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Boston's economic data reveals a mixed picture across various indicators. The metropolitan area's unemployment rate stands at 3.9%, placing it in the 58th percentile among comparable regions, suggesting a relatively stable labour market. The labour force participation rate of 68.47% ranks higher, at the 84th percentile, indicating a robust engagement of the working-age population in the economy. Year-over-year earnings growth is reported at 4.74%, which is at the median level (50th percentile), reflecting moderate income expansion.

Housing and construction metrics present a more complex picture. Building permits have decreased by 7.9% year-over-year, placing Boston in the 32nd percentile, which may reflect a slowdown in new residential or commercial development. The housing price index has increased by 2.95% over the same period, also at the 32nd percentile, suggesting a modest appreciation in property values. The supply of for-sale homes has marginally contracted by 0.29%, while the average days on market remain steady at 60 days, both indicators being around the middle of the distribution.

Boston's overall economic performance is below average relative to other metropolitan areas, with a weighted percentile score of 47.6 and a grade of B-. Strengths in labour force participation are offset by weaker indicators in housing and construction.
