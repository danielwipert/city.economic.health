# Boston — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Boston-Cambridge-Newton metropolitan area ranks 11th among major U.S. metros, with a weighted percentile score of 49.8 and a grade of B-, described as "Below Average." The unemployment rate is 3.9%, placing it in the 70th percentile, indicating a relatively low level of joblessness compared to other regions. The labor force participation rate is 68.47%, ranking in the 84th percentile, suggesting a high proportion of the working-age population is either employed or actively seeking employment.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 2.1%, placing Boston in the 22nd percentile. This may reflect a slower pace of wage increases relative to other areas. The cost of living index is 146.46 (6.46 times the national average), in the 10th percentile, suggesting that living expenses in Boston are higher than in most other metro areas. Housing market indicators show a mixed picture: the housing price index increased by 4.14% year-over-year, placing it in the 40th percentile, while the number of building permits declined by 25.94%, in the 18th percentile. The days on market for homes is 37, in the 92nd percentile, suggesting that properties are taking longer to sell compared to other markets.

These data points suggest a metropolitan area with a strong labor market but facing challenges in housing affordability and construction activity.
