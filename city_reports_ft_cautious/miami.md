# Miami — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area ranks 6th in the dataset, with a weighted percentile score of 46.3, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate is 3.6%, which is relatively low and aligns with broader national trends, ranking at the 70th percentile. The labour force participation rate is 62.01%, below the median, at the 24th percentile, indicating a lower engagement of the working-age population in the labour market. Earnings growth over the past year is 7.05%, placing the region at the 86th percentile, indicating strong wage growth. However, the cost of living has risen by 5.73%, placing it at the 20th percentile, which may reflect higher living expenses. The average weekly hours worked is 34.9, a figure that is above average, at the 82nd percentile.

Housing indicators present a mixed picture. The housing price index has decreased by 1.26% year-over-year, placing the region at the 8th percentile, while the price-to-square-foot ratio has declined by 3.06%, at the 12th percentile, indicating a softening in the housing market. Properties remain on the market for an average of 84 days, the lowest in the dataset, at the 0th percentile, which may reflect a balanced market with neither a surplus nor a shortage of housing inventory. Building permits have increased by 76.97% year-over-year, a significant rise, placing the region at the 94th percentile, suggesting a strong construction sector.

The data suggests a dynamic labour market with strong wage growth and high construction activity, but also highlights challenges in labour force participation and cost of living. The economic environment in Miami appears to be complex, with both strengths and areas of concern.
