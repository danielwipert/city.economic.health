# Miami — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area has a weighted percentile score of 46.3 in a recent economic assessment, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate stands at 3.6%, which is relatively low, suggesting a stable labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 62.01% is below the national average, indicating potential underutilization of the workforce.

Year-over-year earnings growth is 7.05%, ranking in the 86th percentile. This may reflect strong wage pressures or improvements in employment quality. The labor market metrics are notable, but the broader economic picture is more nuanced.

Housing market indicators show mixed trends. Building permits have increased by 76.97% year-over-year, a significant rise that could signal ongoing development and investment in the region. In contrast, the housing price index has declined by 1.26% over the same period, while the price-to-rent ratio has decreased by 3.06%. The average days on market for properties has risen to 84 days, the lowest percentile score in the dataset, which may indicate a slowdown in property sales.

The data suggests a complex economic landscape in Miami, with strong labor market metrics and earnings growth offset by signs of a moderating housing market.
