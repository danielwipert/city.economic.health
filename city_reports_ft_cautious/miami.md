# Miami — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area has a weighted percentile score of 47.5 in a recent economic assessment, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, a relatively low rate that suggests a stable labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 62.23% is below the median, indicating that a portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labour market. Year-over-year earnings growth is 7.05%, placing it in the 86th percentile, which may reflect wage pressures or improvements in employment quality.

Housing market indicators show a mixed picture. Building permits have increased by 76.97% year-over-year, a notable rise that could signal construction activity and potential housing supply expansion. Conversely, the housing price index has declined by 1.26% over the same period, while the price-to-rent ratio has fallen by 3.06%, suggesting a cooling in the housing market. Properties are taking an average of 84 days to sell, which is longer than in many other markets, possibly indicating a slowdown in demand or an oversupply of homes.

The data presents a complex economic landscape in Miami, with strong labour market metrics and construction activity contrasting with signs of a softening housing market.
