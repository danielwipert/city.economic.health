# Miami — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area has a weighted percentile score of 45.3 in a recent economic assessment, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate stands at 3.6%, a relatively low rate that suggests a stable labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 62.01% is below the median, indicating that a portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labour market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 9.47%, placing the region in the 90th percentile for this metric. This growth may be influenced by a tightening labour market or shifts in industry composition. 

Housing and construction indicators present a mixed picture. Building permits have increased by 76.97% year-over-year, indicating ongoing investment in residential and commercial development. However, the housing price index has declined by 1.04% over the same period, and the days-on-market metric stands at 84 days, which is notably high. The cost of living has risen by 5.64%, and the owner-occupied housing rate has decreased by 1.96 percentage points, suggesting potential affordability issues.

The data suggests a complex economic landscape in Miami, characterised by strong labour market dynamics and earnings growth, but also by challenges in the housing sector and labour force participation.
