## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area ranks sixth in the dataset, with a weighted percentile score of 43.6, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate is 3.5%, a relatively low level, and the labour force participation rate is 62.53%, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth is 7.12%, outpacing the cost of living increase of 5.72%. This suggests that real wages may be improving, although the data does not provide a definitive conclusion on this point.

In the housing market, the year-over-year change in the housing price index is -1.03%, and the year-over-year change in the price-to-sale ratio is -2.69%, indicating a slight decline in housing prices and sales prices. The number of building permits issued has increased by 7.44% year-over-year, suggesting continued interest in new construction. The average days on market for properties is 88 days, a relatively high figure that may reflect a slowdown in the pace of sales. The data indicates a mixed economic environment, with some positive trends in employment and earnings, but signs of cooling in the housing sector.

The patterns observed suggest a complex economic landscape in Miami, with both strengths and areas of potential concern.
