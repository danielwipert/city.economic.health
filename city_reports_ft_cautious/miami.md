# Miami — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area ranks sixth in the dataset, with a weighted percentile score of 48.5, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate is 3.7%, a relatively low rate that suggests a stable labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 62.23% is below the median, indicating that a portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labour force. Year-over-year earnings growth is 8.0%, placing it in the 86th percentile, suggesting strong income gains for those employed.

Housing and construction indicators show mixed trends. Building permits have increased by 76.97% year-over-year, which may reflect ongoing demand for new housing or commercial space. Conversely, the housing price index has declined by 1.26% over the same period, while the price per square foot has decreased by 3.51%. The number of days on market has risen to 86 days, suggesting a cooling in the housing market. The cost of living index is 5.67, which is relatively low compared to other major metropolitan areas, potentially making the region more attractive to residents and businesses.

The data suggests a labour market with low unemployment and strong earnings growth, but also highlights challenges in labour force participation and a cooling housing market.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area ranks sixth in the dataset, with a weighted percentile score of 48.5, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, which is relatively low and suggests a stable labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 62.23% is below the median, indicating that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labor force. Year-over-year earnings growth is robust at 8.0%, placing it in the 86th percentile, suggesting strong income gains for those employed.

Housing and construction indicators present a mixed picture. Building permits have increased by 76.97% year-over-year, a substantial rise that may reflect ongoing demand for new housing or commercial space. Conversely, the housing price index has declined by 1.26% over the same period, while the price per square foot has decreased by 3.51%. These declines, coupled with an increase in days on market to 86 days, suggest a cooling in the housing market. The cost of living index stands at 5.67, which is relatively low compared to other major metropolitan areas, potentially making the region more attractive to residents and businesses.

In summary, the data indicates a labor market with low unemployment and strong earnings growth, but also highlights challenges in labor force participation and a cooling housing market.
