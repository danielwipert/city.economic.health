## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Miami-Fort Lauderdale-West Palm Beach metropolitan area has a weighted percentile score of 46.5 in a recent economic assessment, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate is 3.6%, a relatively low rate that suggests a stable labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 62.01% is below the national average, indicating that some potential workforce capacity may not be being utilised.

Year-over-year earnings growth is 7.05%, ranking in the 86th percentile, suggesting strong income gains for those employed. Housing market indicators present a mixed picture. Building permits have increased by 76.97% year-over-year, reflecting significant construction activity. However, the housing price index has declined by 1.04% over the same period, and the days-on-market metric is 84 days, which is notably high.

The cost of living index is 5.73, and weekly hours worked average 34.9 hours, both of which are within moderate ranges. Overall, the data suggests a metropolitan area with a strong labour market and active construction sector, but also facing challenges in the housing market and potentially underutilised labour resources.
