# Grand Rapids — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Grand Rapids-Wyoming-Kentwood metropolitan area presents a mixed picture across several key indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 4.0%, slightly above the median for other metropolitan areas, which may indicate a relatively stable labor market. The labor force participation rate of 65.46% is above average, suggesting a higher proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labor force. Year-over-year earnings growth of 3.57% is moderate, ranking in the lower third percentile, which could suggest slower income growth relative to other regions.

In the housing sector, data indicates robust activity. The year-over-year increase in housing permits of 15.2% and a home price index growth of 19.4% both rank in the upper quartile, suggesting strong demand and construction activity. The pace of sales, as indicated by the 56 days on market, is relatively quick, further supporting the notion of a vibrant housing market. However, the cost of living, which is 58% below the national average, and the weekly hours worked, averaging 34.4 hours, are both near the median, indicating that these factors are neither particularly high nor low compared to other regions.

The weighted percentile score of 67.5 and the grade of B+ suggest that Grand Rapids-Wyoming-Kentwood is performing above average relative to its peers, with strengths in housing and labor force participation, but with more moderate performance in earnings growth.
