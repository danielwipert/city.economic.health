# Indianapolis — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Indianapolis-Carmel-Greenwood metropolitan area's economic data shows a mixed but generally positive performance across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 3.6%, placing it in the 84th percentile among comparable regions. The labour force participation rate of 67.95% is also relatively high, ranking in the 78th percentile. Year-over-year earnings growth of 6.5% and cost of living increase of 4.5% suggest that wages are outpacing inflation.

Housing market indicators show a year-over-year home price index increase of 14.37%, which is higher than the national average. The number of building permits has increased by 5.24% compared to the previous year. A median days-on-market of 52 days indicates a healthy demand for housing. However, the lack of change in the supply of for-sale homes (0.0% year-over-year) suggests potential constraints in supply. The weighted percentile score of 68.8 and an overall grade of B+ further indicate the area's above-average performance.

The data suggests a resilient labour market and a strong housing sector, with wage growth outpacing inflation and a steady increase in construction activity.
