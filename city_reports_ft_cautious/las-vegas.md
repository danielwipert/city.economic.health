# Las Vegas — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Las Vegas-Henderson-North Las Vegas metropolitan area has a weighted percentile score of 30.6 and a grade of C+, described as "Poor", in a recent economic assessment. The area's unemployment rate stands at 5.7%, placing it in the 4th percentile, indicating a relatively high level of joblessness compared to other metropolitan areas. The labour force participation rate is 64.24%, at the 42nd percentile, suggesting moderate engagement in the workforce.

Earnings growth year-over-year is 4.88%, ranking in the 70th percentile, indicating a positive trend in income levels. However, this is somewhat offset by a cost of living increase of 5.35%, which is at the 34th percentile, potentially eroding purchasing power. The housing market shows a decline, with a year-over-year decrease in home prices of 0.66% and a 1.49% drop in single-family home sales, both placing in the lower percentiles (12th and 36th, respectively). Building permits have declined by 46.49% year-over-year, the lowest percentile score (0th), which may reflect a slowdown in construction activity. The average days on market for properties is 64 days, at the 20th percentile, indicating a less active real estate market.

The data suggests a mixed economic environment in Las Vegas, with some positive indicators in earnings growth and labour force participation, but challenges in employment rates, cost of living and the housing market.
