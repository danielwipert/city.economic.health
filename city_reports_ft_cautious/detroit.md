## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The economic data for the Detroit-Warren-Dearborn metropolitan area presents a mixed picture, with some indicators showing modest growth while others lag behind national trends. The unemployment rate stands at 5.1%, placing the region in the 8th percentile nationally, which suggests a relatively high level of joblessness compared to other metropolitan areas. Labor force participation is at 61.07%, ranking in the 22nd percentile, indicating a moderate engagement of the working-age population in the labor market. Year-over-year earnings growth is reported at 2.74%, also in the 22nd percentile, suggesting that wage increases are modest and may not be keeping pace with inflation.

Housing market indicators show a more positive trend, with a year-over-year increase in housing permits of 15.2%, placing the region in the 74th percentile, which indicates a robust level of new construction activity. The housing price index has risen by 3.5% year-over-year, in the 38th percentile, reflecting moderate appreciation in property values. However, the physical stock of housing has slightly contracted, with a year-over-year change of -0.38%, in the 54th percentile, which may reflect a balance between new construction and the removal of older units from the market. The median days on market for homes is 54 days, in the 84th percentile, suggesting a relatively slow pace of sales.

Overall, the data suggests a region with a labor market that faces challenges but a housing sector that shows signs of strength.
