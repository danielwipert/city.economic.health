## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Detroit-Warren-Dearborn metropolitan area's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The unemployment rate is 4.3%, placing the region at the 48th percentile nationally, indicating a labour market that is neither exceptionally strong nor weak compared to other metropolitan areas. Labour force participation is lower, at 60.93%, ranking in the 22nd percentile, suggesting a relatively smaller share of the population actively engaged in the labour market. Earnings growth year-over-year is 4.58%, ranking in the 56th percentile, indicating wage growth that aligns with broader national trends.

Housing market indicators show some positive signs. Building permits have increased by 57.77% year-over-year, a significant rise that ranks in the 88th percentile, suggesting robust construction activity. However, the housing price index has grown by 3.7% year-over-year, placing it in the 36th percentile, which may reflect a more tempered appreciation in home values. The number of single-family homes for sale has decreased by 1.09% year-over-year, while the average days on market remain at 42 days, both metrics falling within the middle range of national performance, indicating a balanced housing market.
