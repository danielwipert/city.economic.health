# Phoenix — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler metropolitan area has a weighted percentile score of 46.8 in a recent economic assessment, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate is 3.5%, a relatively low rate that suggests a stable labour market. The labour force participation rate stands at 66.34%, indicating a high level of engagement among the working-age population. Year-over-year earnings growth is 4.52%, a moderate increase in line with broader economic trends.

However, some indicators suggest potential areas of concern. Building permits have declined by 29.72% year-over-year, which may reflect a slowdown in construction activity. The housing price index has decreased by 1.36% over the same period, indicating a cooling in the real estate market. The days-on-market metric has risen to 75 days, a significant increase that could be related to changes in buyer behaviour or a supply-demand imbalance. The price-to-square-foot ratio has also declined, down 2.18% year-over-year, further highlighting softening conditions in the housing sector.

The data presents a mixed economic picture for Phoenix, with some positive labour market indicators offset by signs of weakening in the housing sector.
