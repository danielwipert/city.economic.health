# Phoenix — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler metropolitan area ranks 10th in a recent economic assessment, with a weighted percentile score of 46.4, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The area's unemployment rate stands at 4.2%, slightly above the national average, while the labor force participation rate is 65.47%, indicating a moderate level of workforce engagement. Year-over-year earnings growth is 5.17%, a steady increase in income levels, though not particularly robust compared to other metrics.

Housing market indicators show mixed trends. The year-over-year change in housing prices has declined by 2.02%, and single-family permits issued have decreased by 21.38%, which may reflect a cooling in the construction sector. The days on market for properties have increased to 58 days, potentially indicating a slowdown in sales pace. The year-over-year change in the price-to-rent ratio has fallen by 1.94%, which could suggest a shift in the dynamics between buying and renting.

The data suggests that Phoenix-Mesa-Chandler maintains a relatively stable economic environment, but faces challenges in employment, housing and construction activity.
