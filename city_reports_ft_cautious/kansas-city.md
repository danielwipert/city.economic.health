## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Kansas City's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and concern. The unemployment rate stands at 3.5%, placing it in the 68th percentile nationally, which suggests a relatively robust labor market. The labor force participation rate of 67.91% is notably high, ranking in the 82nd percentile, indicating a strong engagement of the working-age population in the economy. Earnings growth over the past year has been solid at 6.8%, placing Kansas City in the 84th percentile, which may reflect a healthy demand for labor. However, the cost of living index at 4.5% and the weekly hours worked at 33.6 hours are more moderate, ranking in the 72nd and 36th percentiles respectively, suggesting some constraints in wage growth and work intensity.

In the housing sector, Kansas City shows significant price appreciation with a 17.0% increase in home prices over the past year, placing it in the 82nd percentile. This strong performance contrasts with a decline in building permits, down 30.01% year-over-year, which ranks in the 4th percentile, potentially indicating a slowdown in new construction. The days on market metric stands at 71 days, in the 42nd percentile, suggesting a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a significant advantage. Rental prices have increased by 1.4% year-over-year, placing the city in the 76th percentile, indicating steady but not excessive rental market pressure.

Overall, Kansas City's economic profile suggests a resilient labor market and strong housing prices, though new construction activity has slowed.
