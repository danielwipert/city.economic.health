Kansas City's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some areas showing strength while others lag behind national trends. The unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, placing it in the 68th percentile nationally, which suggests a relatively robust labor market. The labor force participation rate of 68.09% is notably high, ranking in the 82nd percentile, indicating a strong engagement of the working-age population in the economy. Earnings growth year-over-year is at 8.13%, placing the region in the 80th percentile, which may reflect a healthy wage environment. However, the cost of living index at 4.41 is in the 72nd percentile, suggesting that rising wages could be offset by increasing living costs.

In the housing sector, the year-over-year change in housing prices is 17.0%, a significant increase that places Kansas City in the 82nd percentile. This contrasts with the year-over-year change in permits, which has declined by 30.01%, ranking in the 4th percentile, potentially indicating a slowdown in new construction activity. The median days on market for homes is 66 days, which is average, and the price-to-rent ratio of 1.2 is in the 12th percentile, suggesting that rental markets may be more favorable compared to home ownership. Overall, these indicators suggest a dynamic but uneven economic landscape in Kansas City.
