## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Kansas City's economic data reveals a mixed performance across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 3.5%, placing it in the 76th percentile, indicating a relatively low level of joblessness compared to other metropolitan areas. The labour force participation rate of 67.98% is also robust, ranking in the 82nd percentile, suggesting a high proportion of the working-age population is either employed or actively seeking employment. However, earnings growth year-over-year is modest at 2.82%, situated in the 40th percentile, which may reflect a slower pace of wage increases relative to other regions.

Housing market indicators show a more varied picture. The housing price index has increased by 17.0% year-over-year, placing it in the 82nd percentile, suggesting a strong appreciation in home values. The number of building permits issued has risen by 10.29% year-over-year, in the 68th percentile, which could indicate ongoing construction activity. The days on market metric stands at 57 days, in the 48th percentile, indicating that homes are selling, but the process is not particularly swift compared to other markets.

Kansas City's economic profile appears to balance moderate employment and labour force metrics with more pronounced activity in the housing sector.
