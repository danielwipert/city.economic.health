# Kansas City — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Kansas City's economic data reveals a mixed picture across various indicators. The metropolitan area's unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, placing it in the 68th percentile among comparable areas. This suggests a relatively healthy labour market. The labour force participation rate of 68.09% ranks higher, at the 82nd percentile, which may reflect a higher engagement of the working-age population.

Annual earnings growth of 6.8% is strong, ranking in the 84th percentile, while the cost of living increase of 4.58% is more moderate, at the 64th percentile. This may indicate some pressure on household budgets, but the extent of this pressure is unclear.

In the housing sector, the annual home price index growth of 17.0% is significant, placing Kansas City in the 82nd percentile. However, building permits have declined by 30.01% year-over-year, ranking in the 4th percentile. This disparity may reflect a tightening supply of new housing units amid rising demand. The rental market appears stable, with a 1.06% increase in rents year-over-year. Homes are taking an average of 66 days to sell, which is at the median level nationally.

Overall, the data suggests that Kansas City's economy is performing at a level that is neither particularly strong nor weak, with strengths in employment and earnings growth balanced by challenges in housing supply.
