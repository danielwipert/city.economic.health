# Cincinnati — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Cincinnati's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and potential concern. The unemployment rate stands at 3.8%, placing it in the 62nd percentile among comparable metropolitan areas, indicating a relatively stable labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 63.36% is in the 34th percentile, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population remains outside the labour force. Weekly earnings growth year-over-year is modest at 1.53%, ranking in the 28th percentile, while the cost of living index is slightly above the national average at 1.01, placing it in the 88th percentile.

In the housing sector, Cincinnati shows robust activity. Housing prices have increased by 20% year-over-year, a significant rise that places the city in the 92nd percentile. Building permits have also seen a substantial increase of 17.69% year-over-year, ranking in the 80th percentile, suggesting ongoing investment in residential construction. The days-on-market metric, at 53 days, is in the 88th percentile, indicating a relatively quick turnover in the housing market. These trends in the housing sector contrast with the more moderate performance in the labour market indicators.

Cincinnati's economic profile suggests a city with a strong housing market but with more subdued dynamics in employment and wages.

Cincinnati's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and potential concern. The unemployment rate stands at 3.8%, placing it in the 62nd percentile among comparable metropolitan areas, which suggests a relatively stable labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 63.36% is in the 34th percentile, indicating that a significant portion of the working-age population remains outside the labor force. Weekly earnings growth year-over-year is modest at 1.53%, ranking in the 28th percentile, while the cost of living index is slightly above the national average at 1.01, placing it in the 88th percentile. This combination may reflect a labor market where wage growth is lagging behind the cost of living.

In the housing sector, Cincinnati shows robust activity. Housing prices have increased by 20% year-over-year, a significant rise that places the city in the 92nd percentile. Building permits have also seen a substantial increase of 17.69% year-over-year, ranking in the 80th percentile, suggesting ongoing investment in residential construction. The days-on-market metric, at 53 days, is in the 88th percentile, indicating a relatively quick turnover in the housing market.
