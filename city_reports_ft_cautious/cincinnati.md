# Cincinnati — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Cincinnati's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The city's unemployment rate stands at 4.1%, placing it in the 44th percentile nationally. This suggests a labour market that is neither exceptionally tight nor particularly slack. The labour force participation rate is 63.68%, slightly below the national median, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce.

Earnings growth over the past year has been modest at 0.89%, ranking in the 4th percentile. This may reflect a relatively stable but not rapidly expanding income environment. In the housing sector, Cincinnati shows signs of a robust market. The home price index has increased by 20% year-over-year, placing the city in the 92nd percentile. This suggests strong demand and potentially rising property values.

However, the pace of single-family home construction permits has grown by only 5.64% year-over-year, ranking in the 62nd percentile. The days-on-market metric stands at 43 days, in the 86th percentile. This may reflect a competitive market where properties are selling relatively quickly.

Overall, Cincinnati's economic performance appears to be average, with notable strengths in housing prices and a stable labour market, but with more subdued earnings growth.
