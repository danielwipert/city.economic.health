# Cincinnati — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Cincinnati's economic data reveals a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 3.8%, ranking in the 62nd percentile nationally, indicating a relatively low level of joblessness. However, the labour force participation rate of 63.36% is lower, ranking in the 34th percentile, suggesting that a portion of the working-age population remains outside the labour market. Earnings growth over the past year has been modest at 0.89%, placing it in the 4th percentile, indicating limited wage expansion relative to other metropolitan areas.

Housing market indicators show more robust activity. The year-over-year increase in housing permits is 17.69%, placing it in the 80th percentile, which may reflect growing construction activity. The housing price index has risen by 20.0% year-over-year, a notable increase that places it in the 92nd percentile, suggesting strong demand for housing. The days on market metric stands at 53 days, in the 88th percentile, indicating a relatively quick turnover in property sales. These figures contrast with a slower growth in personal services and finance, with a year-over-year increase of 2.71%, placing it in the 84th percentile.

The data suggests a Cincinnati economy with strong housing dynamics but more moderate performance in employment and earnings growth.
