The city's unemployment rate stands at 3.8%, placing it in the 62nd percentile among comparable metropolitan areas, suggesting a relatively stable labour market.

Building permits have also increased by 37.92% year-over-year, ranking in the 86th percentile, suggesting ongoing investment in residential construction. The average number of days a property remains on the market is 53 days, which is relatively high and may indicate challenges in matching supply with buyer expectations.
