# Birmingham — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Birmingham's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The city's unemployment rate of 2.5% places it in the 98th percentile among comparable regions, indicating a relatively strong labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.73% ranks in the 20th percentile, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labor market. Earnings growth year-over-year is 1.65%, placing it in the 12th percentile, while the cost of living index of 7.13 is relatively low, in the 6th percentile.

In the housing market, Birmingham shows a strong performance in new building permits, with a year-over-year increase of 32.24%, ranking in the 90th percentile. This suggests ongoing construction activity. The home price index has risen by 10.88% year-over-year, placing it in the 68th percentile, indicating a steady appreciation in property values. However, the days on market metric of 73.0 days, in the 18th percentile, suggests that properties are taking longer to sell compared to other markets.

Birmingham's economic profile is characterized by a strong labor market and active housing construction, but with moderate earnings growth and a relatively low labor force participation rate. The city's economic grade of "B" and a weighted percentile of 53.2 suggest an average performance across key indicators.

Birmingham's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both strengths and areas of concern. The city's unemployment rate stands at 2.5%, placing it in the 98th percentile among comparable regions, which suggests a robust labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.73% is relatively low, ranking in the 20th percentile, indicating that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labor market. Earnings growth year-over-year is modest at 1.65%, placing it in the 12th percentile, while the cost of living index of 7.13 is also relatively low, in the 6th percentile, which may reflect lower living costs compared to other urban centers.

In the housing market, Birmingham shows a strong performance in new building permits, with a year-over-year increase of 32.24%, ranking in the 90th percentile. This suggests ongoing construction activity and potential growth in the housing sector. The home price index has risen by 10.88% year-over-year, placing it in the 68th percentile, indicating a steady appreciation in property values. However, the days on market metric of 73.0 days, in the 18th percentile, suggests that properties are taking longer to sell compared to other markets, which may reflect a more balanced buyer-seller dynamic.

Overall, Birmingham's economic profile is characterized by a strong labor market and active housing construction, but with moderate earnings growth and a relatively low labor force participation rate. The city's economic grade of "B" and a weighted percentile of 53.2 suggest an average performance across key indicators.
