## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Birmingham's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and challenges. The city's unemployment rate stands at 2.8%, placing it in the 96th percentile among comparable regions, which suggests a relatively robust labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.48% is in the 12th percentile, indicating a lower proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labor market compared to other areas. Earnings growth year-over-year is modest at 1.65%, ranking in the 12th percentile, while the cost of living increase of 7.15% is in the 4th percentile, suggesting that wage growth may not be keeping pace with inflation.

In the housing market, the annual house price index growth of 10.88% places Birmingham in the 68th percentile, indicating a relatively strong appreciation in property values. The number of building permits issued has increased by 1.56% year-over-year, ranking in the 52nd percentile, which may reflect ongoing construction activity. However, the days on market for properties have remained at 64 days, in the 20th percentile, suggesting a more balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a significant advantage.

Overall, Birmingham's economic performance appears to be below average, with some indicators showing resilience while others highlight areas for concern.
