## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Birmingham's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and challenges. The city's unemployment rate stands at 2.8%, placing it in the 96th percentile, which suggests a robust labor market with low joblessness. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.48% is relatively low, ranking in the 12th percentile, indicating that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labor market. Earnings growth over the past year has been modest at 1.96%, placing the city in the 28th percentile, while the cost of living index of 7.14 is in the 10th percentile, suggesting that wage increases may not be keeping pace with living costs.

In the housing market, Birmingham's home price index has increased by 10.88% year-over-year, placing it in the 68th percentile, which indicates a relatively strong housing market. The permit issuance for new residential construction has grown by 1.56% year-over-year, ranking in the 52nd percentile, suggesting moderate expansion in the housing sector. However, the days on market for properties have increased to 64 days, placing the city in the 20th percentile, which may reflect a slowdown in property sales or a shift in buyer preferences.

Overall, Birmingham's economic performance appears to be average, with strengths in employment and housing prices but challenges in labor force participation and wage growth.
