## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Birmingham's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and challenge. The city ranks 47th overall, with a weighted percentile score of 53.2, placing it in the average category. Unemployment stands at 2.5%, which is significantly lower than the national average, as indicated by its 98th percentile ranking. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.73% is relatively low, ranking in the 20th percentile, suggesting that a substantial portion of the working-age population remains outside the labor market.

Earnings growth year-over-year is modest at 1.65%, placing Birmingham in the 12th percentile, while the cost of living index of 7.13 is also low, ranking in the 6th percentile. This may reflect a combination of lower wages and living costs compared to more prosperous regions. Housing market indicators show a more dynamic trend, with housing prices increasing by 10.88% year-over-year, ranking in the 68th percentile, and building permits up by 39.06%, ranking in the 90th percentile. These figures suggest a growing demand for housing, although the number of days properties remain on the market (73 days) is relatively high, ranking in the 18th percentile, indicating some challenges in property sales.

Overall, Birmingham's economic landscape is characterized by low unemployment and robust housing market activity, balanced against lower labor force participation and modest earnings growth.
