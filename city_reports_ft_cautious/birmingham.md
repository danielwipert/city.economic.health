# Birmingham — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Birmingham's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The city's unemployment rate stands at 2.5%, placing it in the 98th percentile, suggesting a relatively strong labor market in terms of job availability. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.73% is in the 20th percentile, indicating a lower proportion of the working-age population is actively engaged in the labor market compared to other regions.

Earnings growth has been modest, with a year-over-year decrease of 0.12%, ranking in the 8th percentile. This decline may be related to broader economic challenges or shifts in the local job market. The cost of living index of 3.12 is in the 80th percentile, suggesting that living costs in Birmingham are relatively high compared to other areas. Housing market indicators show a more positive trend, with a 32.24% increase in building permits year-over-year and a 10.88% rise in home prices, both of which are in the 90th and 68th percentiles, respectively. These figures indicate a strong demand for housing and potential investment in the construction sector.

Birmingham's economic performance is generally in line with national trends, with some areas showing relative strength and others lagging behind. Employment and housing markets appear to be performing well, but labor force participation and earnings growth are lower than in other regions.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Birmingham's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some areas showing relative strength while others lag behind national trends. The city's unemployment rate stands at 2.5%, placing it in the 98th percentile, which suggests a robust labor market in terms of job availability. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.73% is in the 20th percentile, indicating a lower proportion of the working-age population is actively engaged in the labor market compared to other regions.

Earnings growth has been modest, with a year-over-year decrease of 0.12%, ranking in the 8th percentile. This decline in earnings may reflect broader economic challenges or shifts in the local job market. In contrast, the cost of living index of 3.12 is in the 80th percentile, suggesting that living costs in Birmingham are relatively high compared to other areas. Housing market indicators show a more positive trend, with a 32.24% increase in building permits year-over-year and a 10.88% rise in home prices, both of which are in the 90th and 68th percentiles, respectively. These figures indicate a strong demand for housing and potential investment in the construction sector.

Overall, Birmingham's economic performance is average, with strengths in employment and housing markets offset by lower labor force participation and earnings growth.
