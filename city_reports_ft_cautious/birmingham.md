# Birmingham — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Birmingham's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some areas showing relative strength while others lag behind national trends. The city's unemployment rate stands at 2.5%, placing it in the 98th percentile, indicating a relatively strong labor market in terms of job availability. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.1% is in the 8th percentile, suggesting a lower proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labor market compared to other regions. Earnings growth year-over-year is at 2.45%, ranking in the 28th percentile, which may reflect broader economic conditions.

In the housing market, Birmingham's home price index has increased by 10.88% year-over-year, placing it in the 68th percentile, indicating a relatively strong housing market. The cost of living, measured by the consumer price index, has risen by 4.97%, situating the city in the 48th percentile, a moderate increase that aligns with general inflationary pressures. Construction activity, as measured by building permits, has grown by 1.56% year-over-year, in the 52nd percentile, suggesting steady growth in the construction sector. The average number of days a property remains on the market is 60 days, in the 24th percentile, which may indicate a balanced market.

Overall, Birmingham's economic performance appears to be average, with some areas showing relative strength and others lagging behind national trends.
