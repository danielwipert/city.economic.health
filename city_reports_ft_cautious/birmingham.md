## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Birmingham's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both strengths and areas of concern. The city's unemployment rate stands at 2.2%, placing it in the 98th percentile, which suggests a robust labor market with low joblessness. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.56% is relatively low, ranking in the 20th percentile, indicating that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labor market. Earnings have declined slightly year-over-year by 0.12%, while the cost of living has increased by 7.12%, potentially squeezing household budgets.

In the housing market, Birmingham has seen a 10.88% increase in home prices year-over-year, which is a positive sign for property values but may pose affordability challenges. The number of building permits has risen by 32.24% year-over-year, suggesting ongoing construction activity and potential economic growth. However, the average days on market for properties is 78 days, which is relatively high and may reflect a slowdown in sales activity. The city's weighted percentile score of 52.6 and its grade of B indicate an average overall economic performance, neither exceptionally strong nor weak.

These data points suggest a balanced but not outstanding economic environment in Birmingham.
