# Birmingham — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Birmingham's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some areas outperforming national trends while others trail behind. The city's unemployment rate stands at 2.5%, placing it in the 98th percentile, indicating a relatively strong labor market in terms of job availability. However, the labor force participation rate of 60.1% is in the 8th percentile, suggesting a lower proportion of the working-age population is actively engaged in the labor market compared to other regions.

Earnings growth year-over-year is at 1.96%, ranking in the 28th percentile, which suggests moderate wage increases that may be influenced by broader economic conditions. In the housing market, Birmingham's home price index has increased by 10.88% year-over-year, placing it in the 68th percentile, indicating a relatively strong housing market. Permits for new construction have risen by 1.56% year-over-year, in the 52nd percentile, suggesting steady growth in new housing development. The average number of days a property remains on the market is 64 days, in the 20th percentile, which may indicate a balanced market.

Weekly hours worked stand at 35.5 hours, in the 90th percentile, indicating that workers in Birmingham are putting in longer hours compared to their counterparts in other regions. Overall, Birmingham's economic performance appears to be below average, with some areas showing relative strength while others lag behind national trends.
