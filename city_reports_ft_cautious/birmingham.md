# Birmingham — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Birmingham's economic performance is characterised by a mixed set of indicators. The city's unemployment rate stands at 2.8%, placing it in the 96th percentile, indicating a relatively low level of joblessness compared to other regions. However, the labour force participation rate of 60.48% is in the 12th percentile, suggesting a lower engagement of the working-age population in the labour market.

Recent data shows year-over-year earnings growth of 1.96%, ranking in the 28th percentile, while the cost of living increase of 7.14% is in the 10th percentile. This may indicate that wage growth is not keeping pace with living costs.

In the housing market, the year-over-year increase in home prices of 10.88% places Birmingham in the 68th percentile, reflecting a moderate appreciation in property values. The year-over-year change in permits issued for new construction projects is up 1.56%, in the 52nd percentile, suggesting a steady but not robust expansion in the construction sector. The average number of days a property remains on the market is 64 days, in the 20th percentile.

Overall, Birmingham's economic indicators suggest a stable but not particularly dynamic economic environment, with some areas showing strength and others lagging behind national trends.
