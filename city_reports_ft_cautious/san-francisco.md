## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont metropolitan area's economic landscape, as of the latest available data, presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.8%, placing it in the 20th percentile nationally, suggesting a relatively stable labour market.
