# San Francisco — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont metropolitan area's economic data, as of the latest available figures, presents a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate of 4.6% places the area in the 24th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively tight labor market. The labor force participation rate of 64.93% is in the 58th percentile, suggesting a moderate level of workforce engagement. Year-over-year earnings growth of 4.29% is in the 62nd percentile, indicating a modest improvement in income levels. However, the cost of living index of 6.19 is in the 16th percentile, suggesting that living costs are relatively high compared to other metropolitan areas. The average weekly hours worked of 33.3 are in the 16th percentile, which may reflect a trend towards part-time or flexible work arrangements.

Housing market indicators show a decline, with a year-over-year decrease in housing prices of 0.83% and a 4.62% drop in the price-to-square-foot ratio, both in the lowest percentiles (10th and 0th, respectively). This suggests a cooling in the housing market, possibly reflecting changes in demand or supply dynamics. The number of days a property remains on the market has increased to 50 days, which is in the 60th percentile, indicating a slower pace of sales. Building permits have declined by 39.96% year-over-year, placing the area in the 2nd percentile, which may reflect a slowdown in new construction activity. The weighted percentile score of 27.5 and the grade of "C" suggest that the region is performing below average relative to other metropolitan areas in the country.

The data indicates a complex economic landscape with some areas of strength and others of concern, without clear evidence of a singular trend driving the overall performance.
