# San Francisco — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.6%, placing it in the 24th percentile nationally. This suggests a relatively stable labour market. The labour force participation rate of 64.93% is near the national median, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth of 4.29% is slightly above average, reflecting modest income gains for workers.

However, housing and construction metrics paint a more nuanced picture. Building permits have declined by 39.96% year-over-year, a notable decrease. The housing price index has decreased by 0.83% over the same period, suggesting a cooling in the housing market. The year-over-year change in the price of single-family homes has fallen by 4.62%, further indicating a slowdown in real estate activity. The average days on market for properties has increased to 50 days, up from previous levels, which may suggest softer demand for housing.

The data suggests a region with a stable but not robust labour market, alongside a housing sector that appears to be experiencing a downturn. The weighted percentile score of 27.5 and the grade of "C" reflect these mixed conditions.
