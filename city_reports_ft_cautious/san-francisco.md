The unemployment rate is 4.6%, placing the region in the 24th percentile nationally, indicating a labour market that is neither particularly robust nor severely distressed.

However, the year-over-year change in permits for new residential construction has declined by 39.96%, ranking in the 2nd percentile, which could indicate a slowdown in new housing development. Property sales frequency is down by 4.62%, and the average days on market for properties is 50 days, both of which are in lower percentiles, suggesting a cooling in the pace of property transactions.
