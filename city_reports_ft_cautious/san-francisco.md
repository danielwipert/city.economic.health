# San Francisco — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate is 4.4%, placing it in the 34th percentile nationally. This suggests a labour market that is neither particularly robust nor distressed. Labour force participation is at 64.92%, slightly above the median. Year-over-year earnings growth is 3.0%, a moderate increase that may reflect steady wage gains.

Housing market indicators show a nuanced story. Building permits have increased by 10.83% year-over-year, placing this metric in the 66th percentile. However, the housing price index has grown by only 0.3% over the same period, indicating stable home values. The pace of sales, as measured by days on market, is 62 days, near the national median. Office space vacancy rates have decreased by 4.81% year-over-year, a notable drop.

The weighted percentile score of 35 and the grade of C+ suggest that the San Francisco metro area is performing below average relative to other U.S. metropolitan areas. This performance appears to be consistent with a range of moderate economic activities and stable conditions across various sectors.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The economic data for the San Francisco-Oakland-Fremont metropolitan area reveals a mixed picture, with some indicators showing modest growth while others indicate stagnation or decline. The unemployment rate stands at 4.4%, placing it in the 34th percentile nationally, suggesting a labor market that is neither particularly robust nor distressed. Labor force participation is at 64.92%, which is slightly above the median but not indicative of a particularly strong engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth is recorded at 3.0%, a moderate increase that may reflect steady but unspectacular wage gains.

Housing market indicators present a more nuanced story. Building permits have increased by 10.83% year-over-year, placing this metric in the 66th percentile, which suggests a relatively active construction sector. However, the housing price index has grown by only 0.3% over the same period, indicating stable but not expanding home values. The pace of sales, as measured by days on market, is 62 days, which is near the national median, suggesting neither a seller's nor a buyer's market. Office space vacancy rates have decreased by 4.81% year-over-year, a significant drop that may reflect changes in demand for commercial real estate.

Overall, the weighted percentile score of 35 and the grade of C+ suggest that the San Francisco metro area is performing below average relative to other U.S. metropolitan areas. This performance appears to be consistent with a range of moderate economic activities and stable conditions across various sectors.
