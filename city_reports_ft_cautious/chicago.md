# Chicago — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Chicago-Naperville-Elgin metropolitan area ranks third in the dataset, with a mixed economic profile based on recent indicators. The unemployment rate of 4.5% places it in the 28th percentile among comparable regions, indicating a relatively stable labour market. The labour force participation rate of 65.04% ranks in the 58th percentile, suggesting a moderate level of workforce engagement. Year-over-year earnings growth of 5.39% aligns with the 58th percentile, indicating modest income gains for workers. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living increase of 4.72%, is within the 54th percentile, with wage growth slightly outpacing inflation.

Housing market indicators present a complex picture. The year-over-year change in housing prices of 5.85% is in the 48th percentile, reflecting moderate appreciation. However, the decline in building permits of 18.25% year-over-year, placing it in the 22nd percentile, may indicate a slowdown in new construction activity. The days on market metric of 54 days is in the 84th percentile, suggesting a relatively slow-moving market. The vacancy rate, with a year-over-year change of 0.64%, is in the 70th percentile, indicating a slight tightening in the rental market.

The weighted percentile score of 45.1 and the grade of B- suggest that Chicago's economic performance is below average relative to other metropolitan areas, with a mix of stable and moderating trends across key indicators.
