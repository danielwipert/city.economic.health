# Fresno — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Fresno's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some areas outperforming national trends while others trail behind. The unemployment rate stands at 8.1%, placing it near the lower end of the percentile rankings, which may reflect challenges in the local job market. Meanwhile, earnings growth year-over-year is 7.6%, ranking in the 90th percentile, indicating significant wage increases for those employed. The labour force participation rate of 60.38% is relatively low, suggesting potential underutilization of the workforce.

In the housing sector, the annual increase in home prices of 9.4% places Fresno in the 60th percentile, indicating moderate appreciation. However, the year-over-year change in permits for new residential construction has surged by 61.97%, ranking in the 92nd percentile, which could be seen as a response to existing supply constraints or a sign of strong demand for new housing. The median days on market for homes is 69 days, which is in line with the 42nd percentile, suggesting a balanced market.

The data suggests that Fresno's economy exhibits both challenges and signs of strength. While employment and labour force participation rates are areas of concern, earnings growth and housing construction show more positive trends.
