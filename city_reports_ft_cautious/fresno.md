## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Fresno's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 7.9%, placing it at the lower end of the percentile rankings. The labor force participation rate of 60.66% is below average, suggesting a lower proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labor market. Earnings growth year-over-year is 4.59%, above the median, indicating some improvement in income levels. However, the cost of living increase of 5.44% suggests that wage growth may not be keeping pace with rising living costs.

Housing market indicators show a varied trend. The year-over-year increase in housing prices is 9.84%, above the median, indicating a strong housing market. However, the year-over-year change in single-family home sales is down by 0.76%, which may reflect a cooling in the sales market. The number of building permits issued has increased by 61.97% year-over-year, a notable rise that suggests ongoing construction activity. The average days on market for homes is 59 days, a relatively moderate figure indicating a balanced market.
