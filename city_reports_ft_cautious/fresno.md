Housing market dynamics in Fresno show a complex pattern. The year-over-year increase in housing prices is 9.4%, placing it in the 60th percentile, which suggests a moderately strong housing market. However, the year-over-year change in single-family home sales is negative at -1.01%, indicating a slight decline in sales activity. The number of days on the market for properties is 58, which is within a typical range, suggesting a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a significant advantage.
