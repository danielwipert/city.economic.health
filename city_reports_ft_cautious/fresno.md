## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Fresno's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some areas showing relative strength while others lag behind national trends. The unemployment rate stands at 7.9%, placing it at the lower end of the percentile rankings, which may reflect challenges in the local job market. The labor force participation rate of 60.66% is also below average, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labor market. On a more positive note, earnings growth year-over-year is at 4.59%, which is above the median, indicating some improvement in wage conditions.

Housing market indicators show a dynamic trend. The year-over-year increase in housing permits is a robust 61.97%, ranking in the 92nd percentile, which suggests a strong level of construction activity. However, the housing price index has grown by 9.4% year-over-year, which, while positive, is slightly below the median. The days on market metric stands at 59 days, which is relatively high, possibly indicating a less competitive market for homebuyers. Additionally, the year-over-year change in single-family home sales is down by 0.76%, which may reflect cooling demand or other market factors.

Overall, the data suggests that while Fresno's economy exhibits some areas of growth, particularly in construction, it faces ongoing challenges in employment and labor force engagement.
