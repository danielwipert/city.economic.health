## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The unemployment rate stands at 7.9%, placing it at the lower end of the percentile rankings. The labour force participation rate of 60.66% is below average, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labour market.

Earnings growth year-over-year is 4.88%, ranking in the 70th percentile, indicating that those employed are experiencing wage increases. Housing market indicators are varied; the housing price index has grown by 9.4% year-over-year, a solid performance. The number of permits issued for new residential construction has surged by 61.97%, placing this metric in the 92nd percentile. However, the supply of existing homes appears to be tightening, as indicated by the 1.01% decline in the number of properties for sale year-over-year.

The data suggests that Fresno's economy has both challenges and areas of strength. Employment and labour force participation rates are lower than average, while earnings growth and some housing market indicators show improvement.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Fresno's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some areas showing relative strength while others lag behind national trends. The unemployment rate stands at 7.9%, placing it at the lower end of the percentile rankings, which may reflect challenges in the local job market. The labor force participation rate of 60.66% is also below average, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labor market.

On a more positive note, earnings growth year-over-year is robust at 4.88%, ranking in the 70th percentile, indicating that those employed are experiencing wage increases. Housing market indicators are varied; the housing price index has grown by 9.4% year-over-year, a solid performance, while the number of permits issued for new residential construction has surged by 61.97%, placing this metric in the 92nd percentile. This suggests a strong demand for new housing. However, the supply of existing homes appears to be tightening, as indicated by the 1.01% decline in the number of properties for sale year-over-year.

Overall, the data indicates that while Fresno faces some economic challenges, particularly in employment and labor force participation, there are also signs of strength in earnings growth and the housing market.
