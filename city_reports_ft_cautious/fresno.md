# Fresno — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Fresno's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some areas showing relative strength while others lag behind national trends. The unemployment rate stands at 8.1%, placing it at the bottom percentile among the metro areas considered, which may reflect challenges in the local job market. The labour force participation rate of 60.38% is relatively low, ranking in the 10th percentile, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labour market.

Earnings growth year-over-year is robust at 7.51%, placing Fresno in the 74th percentile, indicating that those employed are experiencing higher income levels. The housing market is also noteworthy, with a 61.97% increase in building permits year-over-year, ranking in the 94th percentile, and a 9.4% increase in home prices, placing it in the 60th percentile. These figures suggest a strong demand for housing and potential economic expansion in the construction sector. However, the pace of sales appears to be slower, with properties taking an average of 69 days to sell, in line with the median performance.

The data suggests that Fresno faces challenges in employment and labour force engagement, but also shows signs of economic activity in earnings growth and the housing market.
