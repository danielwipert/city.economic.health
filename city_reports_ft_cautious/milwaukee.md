# Milwaukee — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Milwaukee-Waukesha metropolitan area's economic performance is reflected in recent data, which shows a mixed picture across several key indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 3.0%, placing it in the 94th percentile among comparable regions, indicating a strong labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 63.2% ranks in the 32nd percentile, suggesting that a significant portion of the population remains outside the labor force.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 3.27%, placing it in the 28th percentile, indicating that wage increases have been relatively restrained compared to other areas. In the housing sector, data reveals both positive and negative trends. Home prices have increased by 21.59% year-over-year, placing the region in the 94th percentile, reflecting strong demand and potentially limited supply. In contrast, building permits have declined by 26.15% over the same period, ranking in the 10th percentile, which may indicate a slowdown in new construction or a shift in development priorities.

The median days on market for homes is 50 days, a figure that ranks in the 98th percentile, suggesting a competitive market where properties are selling relatively quickly. Overall, the data suggests that the Milwaukee-Waukesha metro area is performing above average, with strengths in employment and housing markets, though some indicators point to potential constraints in labor force participation and new construction.
