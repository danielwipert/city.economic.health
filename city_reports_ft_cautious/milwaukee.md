# Milwaukee — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Milwaukee-Waukesha metropolitan area presents a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate of 3.7% places it in the 76th percentile among comparable regions, indicating a relatively low level of joblessness. The labour force participation rate of 64.09% ranks in the 42nd percentile, suggesting that while employment is robust, there may be scope for further workforce engagement. Year-over-year earnings growth of 2.34% is below average, with a percentile score of 26, indicating slower wage growth compared to other areas.

Housing market indicators show a complex picture. The year-over-year increase in home prices of 21.59% is significantly higher than the national average, placing it in the 94th percentile. This strong appreciation in home values contrasts with a decline in building permits, down 16.64% year-over-year, which ranks in the 32nd percentile. The discrepancy between these indicators may reflect a combination of high demand and constrained supply in the housing market. The days-on-market metric of 32 days is in the 98th percentile, suggesting a rapid turnover in property sales, consistent with the strong price growth observed.

The data suggests that Milwaukee-Waukesha has a resilient labour market and a robust housing sector, although wage growth remains a point of concern.
