# Milwaukee — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Milwaukee-Waukesha metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate of 3.0% places the region in the 94th percentile, indicating a relatively strong labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 63.2% ranks in the 32nd percentile, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population remains outside the labour force.

Year-over-year earnings growth of 3.73% places the region in the 56th percentile, indicating modest income growth. Housing market dynamics are notable. The year-over-year increase in home prices of 21.59% is substantial, placing the region in the 94th percentile. This may reflect strong demand or limited supply. In contrast, the number of building permits has declined by 26.15% year-over-year, ranking in the 10th percentile, which could indicate a slowdown in new construction.

The median days on market for homes is 50 days, in the 98th percentile, suggesting a relatively slow-moving market despite rising prices. Overall, the data indicates a labour market with low unemployment but moderate participation, alongside a housing market characterised by high price appreciation and a decline in new construction activity. The weighted percentile score of 64.9 and a grade of B+ suggest above-average economic performance, with areas of both strength and concern.
