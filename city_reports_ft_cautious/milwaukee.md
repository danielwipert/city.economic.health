# Milwaukee — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Milwaukee-Waukesha metropolitan area ranks 40th in the dataset, with an economic profile that is generally stable but not robust. The unemployment rate stands at 3.0%, placing it in the 94th percentile, indicating a relatively low level of joblessness. However, the labour force participation rate of 62.75% is at the 28th percentile, suggesting a lower engagement of the working-age population in the labour market. Year-over-year earnings growth is 3.99%, positioned in the 58th percentile, indicating moderate wage growth. The cost of living index is 0.64, in the 94th percentile, which may reflect a relatively affordable living environment compared to other metropolitan areas. The average weekly hours worked are 34.4, in the 64th percentile, suggesting a moderate level of work hours.

Housing indicators show a mixed picture. The year-over-year change in housing permits is down by 16.64%, in the 32nd percentile, which could indicate a slowdown in new construction activity. The housing price index has increased by 21.59% year-over-year, placing it in the 94th percentile, suggesting a strong housing market. The price-to-square-foot ratio has risen by 4.91% year-over-year, also in the 94th percentile, indicating rising property values. Properties are taking an average of 38 days to sell, in the 98th percentile, which may reflect a competitive market with relatively quick sales cycles. The weighted percentile score of 68.1 and a grade of B+ suggest that Milwaukee-Waukesha is performing above average, with notable contrasts in labour market engagement and housing dynamics.

These data points highlight a metropolitan area with some strengths in employment and housing markets, but also areas of potential concern in labour force participation and new construction activity.
