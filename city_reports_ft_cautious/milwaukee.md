# Milwaukee — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Milwaukee-Waukesha metropolitan area presents a mixed picture across several key indicators. The unemployment rate is 3.0%, placing it in the 94th percentile, indicating a strong labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 62.75% is in the 28th percentile, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively participating in the labour market. Year-over-year earnings growth is 3.99%, in the 58th percentile, indicating moderate wage growth. The cost of living index is 0.64, in the 94th percentile, which may reflect relatively affordable living costs compared to other metropolitan areas. The average weekly hours worked is 34.4, in the 64th percentile, suggesting a standard workweek that is slightly above the national average.

Housing market indicators show a year-over-year increase in the housing price index of 21.59%, in the 94th percentile, and a 4.91% increase in the price-to-rent ratio, also in the 94th percentile, indicating strong housing demand and rising prices. However, building permits have decreased by 16.64% year-over-year, in the 32nd percentile, which may indicate a slowdown in new construction. Properties are taking an average of 38 days to sell, in the 98th percentile, suggesting a relatively quick turnover in the housing market. The weighted percentile score of 68.1 and a grade of B+ indicate that Milwaukee-Waukesha is performing above average relative to other metropolitan areas, with notable strengths in unemployment, cost of living, and housing market dynamics, but with some areas of concern in labour force participation and new construction activity.

The data suggests that the Milwaukee-Waukesha economy is characterised by a resilient but uneven environment.
