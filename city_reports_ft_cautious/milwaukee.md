## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The economic data for the Milwaukee-Waukesha metropolitan area presents a mixed picture, with some indicators performing well above average while others lag behind. The unemployment rate stands at 3.0%, placing the region in the 94th percentile, which suggests a robust labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 63.2% is more modest, ranking in the 32nd percentile, indicating that a significant portion of the working-age population remains outside the labor force. Year-over-year earnings growth is at 3.27%, a figure that, while positive, places the region in the 28th percentile, suggesting moderate wage growth relative to other areas.

In the housing sector, the data reveals both strength and caution. The home price index has increased by 21.59% year-over-year, placing the region in the 94th percentile, which may reflect strong demand or limited supply. Conversely, the number of building permits has declined by 6.88% over the same period, ranking in the 38th percentile, potentially indicating a slowdown in new construction. The days on market metric stands at 50 days, placing it in the 98th percentile, which could suggest a competitive market where properties are selling relatively quickly.

Overall, the data indicates a regional economy with strong employment and housing markets, but with some areas showing signs of moderation.
