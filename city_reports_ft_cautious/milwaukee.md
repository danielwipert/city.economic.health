# Milwaukee — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Milwaukee-Waukesha metropolitan area's economic data shows a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate of 3.7% places it in the 76th percentile among similar regions, indicating a relatively low level of joblessness. The labour force participation rate of 64.09% ranks in the 42nd percentile, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population is engaged in the labour market, but there is room for improvement. Year-over-year earnings growth of 3.99% is solid, positioned in the 58th percentile, indicating steady income gains for those employed.

Housing market dynamics are characterised by both strength and challenges. The year-over-year increase in home prices of 21.59% places the region in the 94th percentile, which may reflect strong demand or limited supply. However, the decline in building permits by 16.64% year-over-year, in the 32nd percentile, suggests a slowdown in new housing construction. The days-on-market metric of 38.0 days, in the 98th percentile, indicates a brisk pace of home sales, which could be a sign of a seller's market. The cost of living index of 0.64, in the 94th percentile, suggests that living costs in Milwaukee-Waukesha are relatively low compared to other metropolitan areas.

The data suggests that the Milwaukee-Waukesha metro area is performing above average in some areas, including employment, earnings growth and housing market activity, although some indicators point to potential constraints in the housing supply.
