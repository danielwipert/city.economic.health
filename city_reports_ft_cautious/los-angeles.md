## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The economic data for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim metropolitan area reveals a mixed picture, with some indicators showing moderate growth while others suggest areas of concern. The unemployment rate stands at 5.9%, placing it in the 4th percentile among comparable regions, which may reflect a relatively tight labor market. Labor force participation is at 63.49%, ranking in the 34th percentile, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth is reported at 4.58%, placing it in the 68th percentile, suggesting a positive trend in income levels. However, the cost of living index at 7.4% and the out-of-work ratio at 1.14, both in lower percentiles (6th and 10th respectively), highlight ongoing challenges for residents in managing their expenses and finding employment.

In the housing sector, the year-over-year change in home prices is a modest 0.36%, ranking in the 24th percentile, which could indicate a stable but not particularly dynamic real estate market. The year-over-year change in permits for new construction is up 6.1%, in the 64th percentile, suggesting a moderate increase in building activity. Conversely, the year-over-year change in the price of square footage for commercial space is down by 2.07%, in the 22nd percentile, which may reflect a softening demand in this segment. The average days on market for homes is 58 days, in the 42nd percentile, indicating a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a significant advantage.

Overall, the weighted percentile score of 28.9 and the grade of "C" suggest that while some sectors show resilience, the broader economic environment in Los Angeles faces challenges that warrant attention.
