# Los Angeles — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim metropolitan area presents a mixed picture, with some indicators showing modest growth and others stagnation or decline. The unemployment rate stands at 5.3%, placing it in the 6th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively high level of joblessness compared to other metropolitan areas. The labour force participation rate of 64.28% is close to the national median, suggesting a moderate proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labour market. Year-over-year earnings growth of 4.5% is slightly above the median, while the cost of living increase of 7.46% ranks in the 2nd percentile, indicating that living expenses are rising faster than incomes.

Housing market indicators show a complex trend. The year-over-year change in housing prices is 0.13%, reflecting a near-stable market. The number of building permits has decreased by 0.67% year-over-year, which may indicate a slowdown in new construction activity. The days on market for properties have increased to 67 days, up from previous levels, which could suggest a cooling in demand or an oversupply of homes. The weighted percentile score of 28 corresponds to a grade of "C" or "Very Poor," indicating that the region's economic performance is below average when compared to other metropolitan areas.

These data points collectively suggest a cautious outlook for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim metro area, with signs of both resilience and challenges across key economic indicators.
