# Los Angeles — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate is 5.9%, placing it in the 4th percentile nationally, which may indicate a relatively tight labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 63.49% is at the 34th percentile, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population remains outside the labour force.

Year-over-year earnings growth of 4.16% is at the 52nd percentile, indicating moderate wage increases. In contrast, the cost of living increase of 7.43% is in the 4th percentile, suggesting higher living costs that could be affecting purchasing power.

The housing market shows a modest year-over-year change in home prices of 0.36%, ranking in the 24th percentile. This suggests a stable market that is not rapidly appreciating. The year-over-year change in permits for new private housing units is up 6.1%, at the 64th percentile, indicating a steady pace of new construction. However, the year-over-year change in the price per square foot for existing homes is down 2.11%, at the 22nd percentile, which may reflect a softening in the resale market. The average number of days on the market for homes is 57 days, at the 40th percentile, suggesting a balanced market.

The weighted percentile score of 28.1 and the grade of "C" for the Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim metro area indicate a performance that is below average relative to other U.S. metropolitan regions.
