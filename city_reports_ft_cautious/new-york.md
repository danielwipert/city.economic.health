# New York — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The New York-Newark-Jersey City metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 5.2%, placing it in the 12th percentile nationally. This suggests a relatively high level of joblessness compared to other regions. The labour force participation rate is 63.15%, below the national median, indicating a lower proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labour market. Earnings have increased year-over-year by 5.45%, ranking in the 70th percentile, suggesting wage growth is outpacing many other areas. However, the cost of living has risen by 6.26% over the same period, placing additional financial pressure on households.

In the housing market, the year-over-year change in home prices has increased by 5.24%, a moderate pace of appreciation that places the region in the 44th percentile. Building permits have fallen by 21.86% year-over-year, ranking in the 22nd percentile, which may indicate a slowdown in new construction activity. The number of days properties remain on the market is 54 days, near the median, suggesting a balanced market. The overall weighted percentile score is 27.3, and a grade of "C" indicates that the New York metro area's economic performance is below average relative to its peers.

These data points collectively present a complex picture of the economy, with both strengths and challenges evident. However, they do not provide a clear indication of future trends.
