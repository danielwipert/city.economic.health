The unemployment rate stands at 5.2%, placing it in the 12th percentile, indicating relatively weak employment conditions compared to other regions.

However, the cost of living index at 6.26 is also in the 12th percentile, suggesting that these wage gains may be offset by higher living costs. The housing market shows a year-over-year increase in home prices of 5.24%, placing this metric in the 44th percentile, while the number of building permits has declined by 21.86%, ranking in the 22nd percentile, which may reflect a slowdown in new construction activity.
