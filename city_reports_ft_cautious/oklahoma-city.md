## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Oklahoma City's economic indicators present a mixed but generally positive picture. The unemployment rate stands at 3.4%, placing it in the 80th percentile among comparable metropolitan areas, which suggests a relatively robust labor market. The labor force participation rate of 66.8% is also above average, indicating a high level of engagement in the workforce. However, earnings growth year-over-year is moderate at 3.49%, ranking in the 52nd percentile, which may reflect a stable but not rapidly expanding income environment.

Housing market indicators show significant activity. The housing price index has increased by 10.86% year-over-year, placing it in the 66th percentile, suggesting a strong demand for housing. Building permits have risen by 10.49% over the same period, in the 70th percentile, which could indicate ongoing investment in residential construction. Despite this growth, the number of days properties remain on the market is 54 days, in the 56th percentile, indicating a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers dominate.

Overall, the data suggests that Oklahoma City is experiencing steady economic conditions with particular strengths in employment and housing markets, though wage growth remains moderate.
