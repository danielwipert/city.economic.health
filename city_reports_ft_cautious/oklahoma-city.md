The weekly hours worked, at 35.4 hours, are notably high, placing the city in the 86th percentile, which may reflect either strong demand for labor or limited part-time employment opportunities.

In the housing market, the year-over-year increase in housing prices of 10.86% places Oklahoma City in the 66th percentile, indicating a steady appreciation in property values. However, the lack of change in permits for new housing construction (0.0% year-over-year) in the 62nd percentile suggests a potential constraint in supply.
