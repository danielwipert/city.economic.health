# Oklahoma City — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Oklahoma City's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The unemployment rate is 3.6%, placing it at the 50th percentile nationally, indicating a labour market that is neither exceptionally tight nor loose. The labour force participation rate of 65.65% ranks higher, at the 70th percentile, suggesting a relatively engaged workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth of 4.7% and a cost of living increase of 4.88% are both within the middle range of national comparisons, with earnings growth slightly outpacing inflation. Average weekly hours worked are 35.8 hours, ranking in the 96th percentile, which may reflect strong demand for labour or limited part-time employment options.

In the housing market, the year-over-year increase in housing prices of 10.86% places Oklahoma City in the 66th percentile, suggesting a steady appreciation in property values. The number of building permits issued has grown by 23.95% year-over-year, a significant increase that ranks in the 86th percentile, indicating robust construction activity. However, the pace of sales, as measured by days on market, remains moderate at 67 days, which is near the median. The vacancy rate for rental properties has increased by 0.2% year-over-year, placing it in the 64th percentile, which could indicate a balanced supply and demand dynamic in the rental market.

These indicators suggest that Oklahoma City's economy is performing above average in some areas, such as labour engagement and construction activity, while facing typical challenges in housing affordability and wage growth.
