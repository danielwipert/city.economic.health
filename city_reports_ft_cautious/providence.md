# Providence — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Providence-Warwick metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, placing it in the 30th percentile nationally. This suggests the labour market is neither particularly robust nor weak compared to other regions. The labour force participation rate of 50.77% is low, ranking at the bottom of the percentile scale, indicating a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labour market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been modest at 2.51%, placing the region in the 20th percentile. This may reflect a slower pace of wage increases relative to other areas. In contrast, housing market indicators show more positive trends. The housing price index has increased by 21.89% year-over-year, a substantial rise that places the region in the 96th percentile. Building permits are also up, by 144.37% year-over-year, suggesting strong construction activity. The days on market metric is 40 days, ranking in the 94th percentile, indicating a relatively quick turnover in the housing market.

The data suggests that while the labour market in Providence-Warwick faces challenges, the housing sector is experiencing growth.
