# Providence — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Providence-Warwick metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, placing the region in the 38th percentile nationally. This suggests a labour market that is neither particularly robust nor weak compared to other metro areas. Labour force participation is low at 50.77%, ranking at the bottom percentile, indicating a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labour market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 2.51%, placing the region in the 20th percentile. This may reflect a slower pace of wage increases relative to other parts of the country. The cost of living index is 1.43, placing the region in the 86th percentile, suggesting that living costs are relatively high. Housing market indicators show strong activity, with housing prices increasing by 21.89% year-over-year and building permits up by 144.37%, both in the 96th percentile. The average days on market is 51.0 days, in the 92nd percentile, indicating a competitive market.

The data suggests a regional economy with areas of strength, particularly in the housing sector, alongside challenges in labour market engagement and wage growth.
