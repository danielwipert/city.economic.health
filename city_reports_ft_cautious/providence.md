# Providence — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Providence-Warwick metropolitan area presents a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, placing it in the 30th percentile nationally. This suggests that employment conditions are not among the best but remain within a reasonable range. The labour force participation rate of 50.77% is low, ranking at the bottom percentile, indicating that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labour market. Year-over-year earnings growth is 0.85%, reflecting a relatively stable but not particularly robust income environment.

Housing market indicators show more positive trends. The year-over-year increase in housing prices is 21.89%, placing Providence in the 96th percentile. This may reflect strong demand or limited supply in the housing sector. Building permits have risen by 144.37% year-over-year, suggesting ongoing investment in residential construction. The cost of living index is 1.94 and the owner-occupied housing costs are 2.84, both above average, indicating higher living expenses relative to other regions. The median days on market for homes has decreased to 40 days, placing it in the 94th percentile, suggesting a competitive market where properties are selling relatively quickly.

The data suggests a complex economic landscape in Providence, with some areas showing strength while others lag behind.
