# Providence — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Providence-Warwick metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, placing it at the 48th percentile nationally. This suggests a labour market that is neither particularly robust nor weak compared to other regions. The labour force participation rate of 50.77% is low, ranking at the bottom percentile, which may be influenced by broader demographic or regional economic factors.

Earnings growth year-over-year is 1.38%, placing Providence in the 12th percentile. This indicates slower wage growth relative to other metro areas. In contrast, the cost of living has increased by 1.92%, placing the region in the 86th percentile. This could be exerting pressure on household budgets. Housing market indicators show significant activity, with housing prices up 21.89% year-over-year and building permits increasing by 144.37%. Both are in the top percentiles, suggesting strong demand for housing. However, the average days on market at 37.0 days is not as rapid as in some other high-growth markets.

The data suggests a regional economy with areas of strength, particularly in housing, but also facing challenges in labour force participation and wage growth.
