# San Diego — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The San Diego-Chula Vista-Carlsbad metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.9%, placing it in the 14th percentile nationally. This suggests that the local labour market is performing moderately well, but not exceptionally so. The labour force participation rate of 62.18% is below the median, indicating a lower engagement of the working-age population in the labour market compared to other regions.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 3.35%, ranking in the 30th percentile. This may reflect a stable but not particularly dynamic wage environment. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is 7.13%, placing it in the 6th percentile. This suggests that residents face significant price pressures. Housing market indicators show a year-over-year decline in home prices of 0.55% and a decrease in permits for new housing units of 2.73%. These figures indicate a cooling in the housing sector, which may be related to broader economic conditions or local factors.

The weighted percentile score of 26.1 and the grade of "C" suggest that San Diego's economic performance is below average when compared to other metropolitan areas.
