# San Diego — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The San Diego-Chula Vista-Carlsbad metropolitan area's economic data, as of the latest available figures, presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.9%, placing it in the 14th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively tight labour market. The labour force participation rate is 62.18%, ranking in the 26th percentile, suggesting a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth is 3.03%, ranking in the 46th percentile, a figure consistent with moderate wage growth. The cost of living index is 7.2, placing it in the 8th percentile, reflecting a higher cost of living compared to many other regions. The overall wage rate, measured by weekly earnings, is 32.7 hours, which is at the bottom of the distribution (0th percentile), suggesting lower average weekly earnings relative to other metropolitan areas.

Housing market indicators show a year-over-year decline in the housing price index of -0.82%, in the 12th percentile, and a decrease in the single-family home price index of -2.73%, in the 18th percentile, indicating a slight cooling in the housing market. The number of days a property remains on the market is 48, in the 68th percentile, which may reflect a balanced market with neither a significant buyer nor seller advantage. Building permits have increased by 61.67% year-over-year, a significant rise placing the region in the 90th percentile, suggesting robust construction activity. The overall weighted percentile score is 27.4, indicating that San Diego's economic performance is below average compared to other metropolitan areas, with particular strengths in construction activity but challenges in wage levels and cost of living.

The data points suggest a region with a stable but not robust economic environment, characterised by moderate employment and wage growth, high living costs, and active construction.
