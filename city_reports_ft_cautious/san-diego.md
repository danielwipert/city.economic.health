# San Diego — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the San Diego-Chula Vista-Carlsbad metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 5.0%, placing it in the 16th percentile among comparable regions. This suggests a labor market that is performing below average. Labor force participation is at 62.1%, which is slightly above the median. However, this still indicates room for improvement in workforce engagement. Year-over-year earnings growth is 2.04%, a modest rate that reflects a stable income environment.

Housing market indicators show contrasting trends. Building permits have increased by 61.67% year-over-year, which may be due to growing demand or investment in construction. However, the housing price index has declined by 0.82% over the same period, and the price-to-square-foot ratio has decreased by 3.13%. The average days on market for properties is 47 days, which is relatively high and suggests a slowdown in property sales. These housing metrics are reflected in a weighted percentile score of 24 and a grade of "C," indicating an overall economic performance that is below average.

The data suggests a stable economic environment in San Diego, with some sectors showing resilience and others facing challenges.
