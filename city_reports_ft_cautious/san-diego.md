The unemployment rate is 5.0%, ranking in the 16th percentile nationally, suggesting a labour market that is neither particularly robust nor severely strained.

Housing and construction metrics show contrasting trends. Building permits have increased by 61.67% year-over-year, placing the region in the 90th percentile, which may indicate strong demand for new housing or commercial space. However, the housing price index has declined by 0.82% over the same period, ranking the region in the 12th percentile, possibly reflecting a cooling in the housing market. The supply of existing homes has decreased by 3.13%, placing the region in the 16th percentile, which could suggest a tightening supply.
