## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the San Diego-Chula Vista-Carlsbad metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.6%, placing it in the 24th percentile nationally.

Earnings growth year-over-year is 3.35%, in the 30th percentile, suggesting moderate wage increases.

Housing and construction indicators show a less positive trend. Building permits have declined by 25.87% year-over-year, placing the region in the 12th percentile.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The economic data for the San Diego-Chula Vista-Carlsbad metropolitan area reveals a mixed picture, with some indicators showing relative strength while others point to areas of concern. The unemployment rate stands at 4.6%, placing it in the 24th percentile nationally, which suggests a labor market that is performing moderately well but not exceptionally so. The labor force participation rate of 62.42% is slightly above the national median, indicating a relatively engaged workforce. Earnings growth year-over-year is at 3.35%, which is in the 30th percentile, suggesting moderate wage increases that may reflect broader economic conditions.

Housing and construction indicators present a more challenging outlook. Building permits have declined by 25.87% year-over-year, placing the region in the 12th percentile, which may indicate a slowdown in residential construction activity. The housing price index has decreased by 0.55% over the same period, also below the national average, potentially reflecting softer demand in the real estate market. Additionally, the days on market for properties have increased to 57 days, which is in the 74th percentile, suggesting a longer time to sell homes compared to other regions. These trends in the housing sector appear to be consistent with a cooling market.

Overall, the data suggests that while San Diego's labor market remains stable, there are signs of moderation in key sectors such as housing and construction.
