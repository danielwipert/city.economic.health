# Sacramento — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Sacramento-Roseville-Folsom metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 5.0%, placing the region in the 14th percentile among similar areas. This suggests a relatively stable labour market, but one that is not particularly robust. The labour force participation rate of 60.49% and the average weekly hours worked at 33.3 hours indicate a labour market that is neither contracting nor expanding rapidly.

Earnings growth year-over-year is recorded at 4.36%, a moderate increase that places the region in the 44th percentile. This suggests some improvement in income levels, but not a significant acceleration. In the housing sector, the year-over-year change in housing prices is 3.1%, indicating steady growth in property values. However, the year-over-year change in single-family home sales is negative at -1.65%, which may reflect a cooling in the housing market or a shift in buyer preferences. The number of days on market for homes has increased to 68 days, up from previous levels, which could suggest a slowdown in the pace of sales.

Building permits have seen a more substantial increase of 19.19% year-over-year, placing the region in the 82nd percentile. This may indicate continued interest in residential construction despite slower sales activity. Overall, the data suggests a cautiously stable economic environment in Sacramento, with some positive trends in employment and construction, but also signs of moderation in the housing market.
