# Sacramento — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Sacramento-Roseville-Folsom metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 5.0%, placing it in the 14th percentile among comparable regions. This suggests that the local labour market faces challenges but remains relatively stable. The labour force participation rate of 60.49% is below average, indicating a potential underutilization of the workforce. Earnings growth year-over-year is reported at 2.48%, ranking in the 38th percentile.

The housing market shows a year-over-year increase in housing prices of 3.1%, placing the metric in the 34th percentile. This suggests a steady but not robust appreciation in property values. The number of building permits has risen by 19.19% year-over-year, a significant increase that ranks in the 82nd percentile. However, the days-on-market indicator is 68 days, in the 44th percentile, suggesting that properties are taking longer to sell compared to more dynamic markets.

The overall weighted percentile score is 27.1, and the assigned grade is "C". This indicates that while some sectors are performing well, the broader economic environment in Sacramento faces ongoing challenges. The data points suggest a nuanced outlook for Sacramento's economy, with areas of both strength and weakness.
