The economic data for the Sacramento-Roseville-Folsom metropolitan area presents a mixed picture, with some indicators showing modest growth while others point to challenges. The unemployment rate stands at 5.2%, placing it in the 10th percentile nationally, which suggests that job market conditions are relatively weak compared to other regions. The labor force participation rate of 60.54% is also below average, ranking in the 14th percentile, indicating a lower proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labor market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been moderate, at 1.74%, placing the region in the 26th percentile. This suggests that while incomes are increasing, the pace is slower than in many other areas. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is at 6.01%, which may be eroding purchasing power and affecting household budgets. Housing market dynamics show a 3.1% increase in home prices year-over-year, but this is accompanied by a 30.14% decline in building permits, suggesting a slowdown in new construction activity. The number of days properties remain on the market has increased to 59 days, which may reflect a cooling in demand or an oversupply of homes.

Overall, the data indicates a region facing moderate economic headwinds, with some sectors showing resilience and others experiencing contraction.
