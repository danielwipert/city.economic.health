# Sacramento — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Sacramento-Roseville-Folsom metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 5.0%, placing it in the 14th percentile among comparable regions. This suggests a relatively stable labour market, but one that is not particularly robust. The labour force participation rate of 60.49% is in the lower percentiles, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce.

Year-over-year earnings growth of 4.36% is in the 44th percentile, suggesting a moderate increase in income levels. However, this is tempered by a cost of living increase of 5.66%, which is in the 18th percentile, potentially eroding purchasing power.

In the housing sector, the year-over-year change in home prices is 3.1%, placing it in the 34th percentile. This indicates a modest appreciation. The number of building permits has declined by 19.76% year-over-year, ranking in the 24th percentile. This may reflect a slowdown in construction activity. The median days on market for homes is 68 days, in the 44th percentile, suggesting a balanced market.

The year-over-year change in rental prices has decreased by 1.65%, in the 36th percentile. This could indicate easing pressure in the rental market. Overall, the data suggests a cautiously stable economic environment in Sacramento, with some areas showing moderate growth and others experiencing slight contractions.
