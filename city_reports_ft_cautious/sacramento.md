## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The economic data for the Sacramento-Roseville-Folsom metropolitan area reveals a mixed picture, with some indicators showing modest growth while others indicate contraction. The unemployment rate stands at 5.4%, placing it in the 8th percentile among comparable regions, which suggests that joblessness remains relatively low but not exceptionally so. Labor force participation is at 60.62%, ranking in the 16th percentile, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the labor market. Year-over-year earnings growth is recorded at 1.74%, which is in the 26th percentile, suggesting a slight improvement in income levels, albeit at a pace slower than many other areas.

Housing market indicators present a more varied picture. The year-over-year change in housing prices is 3.1%, placing it in the 32nd percentile, which may reflect a stable but not robust housing market. However, the year-over-year change in single-family home sales is down by 1.83%, in the 30th percentile, and building permits have declined by 30.14% year-over-year, ranking in the 14th percentile. These figures suggest a slowdown in both sales and new construction activity. Additionally, the average number of days on the market for homes is 59 days, in the 40th percentile, which could indicate a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers hold a significant advantage.

Overall, the weighted percentile score of 18.3 and the grade of C- for the Sacramento-Roseville-Folsom metro area suggest a critical but not dire economic situation, characterized by moderate performance across most indicators.
