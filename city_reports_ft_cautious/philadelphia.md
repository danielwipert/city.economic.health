The Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington metropolitan area ranks 9th among major U.S. metros, with an overall grade of B, indicating average performance across a range of economic indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 4.0%, placing it in the 34th percentile nationally, which suggests a labor market that is neither particularly strong nor weak compared to other regions. The labor force participation rate of 63.96% is also in the 42nd percentile, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth is at 2.21%, placing it in the 34th percentile, while the cost of living index of 5.41 is in the 32nd percentile, suggesting that wage growth may be keeping pace with living costs, though not outpacing them significantly.

In the housing market, the year-over-year increase in home prices is 14.25%, placing it in the 70th percentile, which indicates a relatively robust housing market. However, the year-over-year change in permits for new housing units is only 1.56%, in the 50th percentile, suggesting a more moderate pace of new construction. The days on market for homes is 64, in the 64th percentile, which may reflect a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a significant advantage. Weekly hours worked average 34.9 hours, in the 80th percentile, indicating a higher than average workweek, which could be a sign of strong demand for labor or limited part-time opportunities.

These data points collectively suggest a metropolitan area with a stable but not exceptional economic environment, characterized by moderate employment, wage growth, and housing market activity.
