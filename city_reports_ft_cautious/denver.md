# Denver — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Denver-Aurora-Centennial metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate is 3.7%, placing it in the 76th percentile, indicating a relatively low level of unemployment compared to other metropolitan areas. The labour force participation rate is 71.28%, ranking in the 92nd percentile, suggesting a high level of workforce engagement. Earnings growth year-over-year is 6.09%, placing it in the 74th percentile, which is a positive sign for income levels in the region.

However, housing indicators show a different trend. The year-over-year change in the housing price index is -0.72%, and the year-over-year change in the price of single-family homes is -3.57%, both ranking in lower percentiles (12th and 8th, respectively). This suggests a decline in housing prices, which may be related to a cooling in the housing market. The number of days on the market for homes is 63 days, which is in the 18th percentile, indicating a slower pace of home sales. Construction activity, as measured by the year-over-year change in building permits, is up 13.55%, placing it in the 74th percentile, suggesting ongoing investment in new housing and commercial development.

Overall, the data suggests a balanced economic environment in Denver, with strong labour market indicators offset by weaker housing market performance.
