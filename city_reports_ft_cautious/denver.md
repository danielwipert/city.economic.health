## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the Denver-Aurora-Centennial metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate is 3.6%, placing it in the 74th percentile among comparable regions. This suggests a relatively low level of joblessness. The labour force participation rate of 70.73% ranks higher at the 92nd percentile, indicating a high level of engagement among the working-age population in the labour market. Year-over-year earnings growth is 6.2%, situating it in the 66th percentile, which reflects moderate wage increases.

In the housing sector, the year-over-year change in the housing price index is -1.32%, placing it in the 8th percentile. This indicates a slight decline in home prices. The year-over-year change in permits for new private housing units is up 14.99%, ranking in the 72nd percentile. This may reflect ongoing construction activity despite the softening in home prices. The average days on market for homes is 79 days, in the 12th percentile, suggesting a slower pace of sales compared to other markets. Weekly hours worked stand at 34.3 hours, in the 48th percentile, indicating average workweek lengths relative to other regions.

The data suggests that some sectors, such as housing, are showing signs of cooling, while others, including employment and labour force participation, remain robust.
