# Denver — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Denver-Aurora-Centennial metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, placing it in the 76th percentile, indicating a relatively low level of unemployment compared to other metropolitan areas. The labour force participation rate is 71.28%, ranking in the 92nd percentile, suggesting a high level of engagement of the working-age population in the labour market. Year-over-year earnings growth of 6.09% is solid, placing it in the 74th percentile. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, has increased by 4.69%, which may reflect broader economic pressures.

On the housing front, the year-over-year change in the housing price index is -0.64%, indicating a modest decline in home prices. This is in contrast to the 13.55% increase in building permits, suggesting continued investment in residential construction despite the slight cooling in home prices. The days-on-market metric stands at 63 days, placing it in the 18th percentile, potentially indicating a slowdown in the pace of home sales. The year-over-year change in the price-to-square-foot ratio is down by 3.57%, suggesting a softening in the housing market.

The data suggests that while Denver's labour market remains strong, there are signs of moderation in the housing sector.
