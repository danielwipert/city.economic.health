# Denver — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Denver-Aurora-Centennial metropolitan area's economic data shows a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 3.9%, slightly above the median for other metropolitan areas, which may indicate a moderate level of labour market tightness. The labour force participation rate of 71.33% ranks high, in the 92nd percentile, suggesting a strong engagement of the working-age population in the labour market. Year-over-year earnings growth is 4.35%, in line with broader national trends, while the cost of living increase of 4.92% suggests that wage growth is keeping pace with inflationary pressures.

In the housing sector, the year-over-year change in home prices has declined by 0.64%, and the year-over-year change in single-family home sales has decreased by 3.48%. These figures, both in the lower percentiles, indicate a cooling in the housing market. The number of days on market for homes is 65 days, which is relatively low, suggesting that while sales volumes have decreased, properties are still selling within a reasonable timeframe. Construction activity, as indicated by the 13.55% year-over-year increase in building permits, remains strong, placing this indicator in the 74th percentile and suggesting continued investment in residential and commercial development.

The data suggests that Denver's economy is experiencing a period of moderate growth with some signs of cooling in the housing market.
