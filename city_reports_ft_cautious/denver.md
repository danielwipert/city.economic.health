# Denver — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Denver-Aurora-Centennial metropolitan area's economic data reveals a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate of 3.7% ranks in the 76th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively strong labour market. The labour force participation rate of 71.28% is high, ranking in the 92nd percentile, suggesting a high level of engagement among the working-age population. Earnings growth year-over-year stands at 4.35%, positioned in the 66th percentile, indicating moderate wage increases.

However, the cost of living index of 4.92 and the overall well-being ratio of 2.58, both in the lower half of national percentiles (54th and 50th respectively), suggest potential challenges in maintaining living standards despite wage growth. 

In the housing sector, the year-over-year change in home prices has declined by 0.64%, placing the metro area in the lower 16th percentile. The price-to-square-foot ratio has decreased by 3.48%, ranking in the 10th percentile. The number of days properties remain on the market has increased to 65 days, also in the 16th percentile. Building permits have increased by 13.55% year-over-year, ranking in the 74th percentile.

The data presents a mixed picture of the economy, with strengths in employment and labour force participation, but challenges in housing and cost of living. The weighted score and percentile suggest an average performance.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The economic data for the Denver-Aurora-Centennial metropolitan area indicates a mixed performance across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 3.7%, placing it in the 76th percentile nationally, which suggests a relatively robust labor market. The labor force participation rate of 71.28% is notably high, ranking in the 92nd percentile, indicating a strong engagement of the working-age population in the economy. Earnings growth year-over-year is at 4.35%, positioned in the 66th percentile, suggesting moderate wage increases. However, the cost of living index at 4.92 and the overall well-being ratio at 2.58, both in the lower half of national percentiles (54th and 50th respectively), may reflect challenges in maintaining living standards despite wage growth.

In the housing sector, the year-over-year change in home prices has declined by 0.64%, while the price-to-square-foot ratio has decreased by 3.48%, both placing the metro area in the lower 16th and 10th percentiles, respectively. This suggests a cooling trend in the housing market. The number of days properties remain on the market has increased to 65 days, also in the 16th percentile, which may indicate a slowdown in property sales. On a more positive note, building permits have increased by 13.55% year-over-year, ranking in the 74th percentile, which could signal continued investment in construction and development.

Overall, the data presents a picture of an economy with strengths in employment and labor force participation, but facing challenges in housing and cost of living, with a weighted score and percentile that suggest an average performance.
