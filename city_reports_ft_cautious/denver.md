# Denver — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Denver-Aurora-Centennial metropolitan area's economic data shows a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 3.9%, placing it in the 54th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively low level of joblessness. The labour force participation rate of 71.33% is high, ranking in the 92nd percentile, suggesting a strong engagement of the working-age population in the labour market. Year-over-year earnings growth of 4.35% places the region in the 66th percentile, indicating moderate wage increases. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, has risen by 4.92% year-over-year, in line with broader national trends.

Housing market indicators present a more nuanced picture. The year-over-year change in housing prices has declined by 0.64%, while the supply of for-sale homes has decreased by 3.48%, both placing the region in the lower percentiles (16th and 10th, respectively). The median days on market remains at 65 days, which is in the 16th percentile, suggesting a relatively stable but slower sales environment. Construction activity, as indicated by building permits, has increased by 13.55% year-over-year, placing the region in the 74th percentile.

The data suggests that Denver's economy is performing in a manner that is neither exceptionally strong nor weak, with some strengths in labour market participation and construction activity, but also facing challenges in the housing sector.
