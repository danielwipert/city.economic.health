# San Jose — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate is 4.5%, placing it in the 26th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively stable labour market that lags behind many other regions. Labour force participation is at 64.66%, ranking in the 52nd percentile, suggesting moderate engagement in the workforce. Earnings have decreased year-over-year by 1.3%, a decline that may be related to broader economic pressures or shifts in the local job market. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is at 7.48%, which is relatively high and could be impacting household budgets.

Housing market indicators show both strength and weakness. Housing prices have increased by 9.58% year-over-year, placing the region in the 62nd percentile, suggesting continued demand for housing despite economic headwinds. The number of building permits has surged by 90.23% year-over-year, a significant increase that ranks in the 96th percentile, which may indicate a response to housing demand or a shift in development strategies. The pace of sales has slowed, with properties taking an average of 43 days to sell, up from previous levels, which could reflect cooling buyer interest or a more balanced market.

The data suggests a complex economic environment in San Jose, with some areas showing resilience and others facing challenges.
