## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metropolitan area's economic data, as of the latest available figures, presents a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate of 4.5% places the region in the 26th percentile nationally, suggesting a relatively tight labor market but not among the tightest. The labor force participation rate of 64.66% is at the 52nd percentile, indicating a moderate level of workforce engagement. Earnings have decreased by 1.3% year-over-year, a decline that places the region in the 4th percentile, suggesting a weakening in income growth. The cost of living index of 7.48 is in the 2nd percentile, reflecting a high cost of living relative to other metropolitan areas. The average weekly hours worked, at 34.3, is at the 60th percentile, indicating a moderate level of work hours.

Housing market indicators show a varied picture. The housing price index has increased by 9.58% year-over-year, placing the region in the 62nd percentile, which may reflect continued demand for housing despite the high cost of living. The permits for new housing units have risen by 90.23% year-over-year, a significant increase that is in the 96th percentile, suggesting a robust construction sector. The days on market for homes is 43, which is in the 86th percentile, indicating a relatively quick turnover in the housing market. The price-to-square-foot ratio has decreased by 3.06% year-over-year, placing it in the 12th percentile, which could indicate a slight easing in housing prices. The weighted percentile score of 41.4 and the grade of B- suggest that San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara is performing below average relative to other metropolitan areas, with notable strengths in housing construction and housing market activity, but challenges in earnings growth and cost of living.

The data highlights a region with a complex economic landscape, where housing market indicators show some resilience, while labor market metrics are softer.
