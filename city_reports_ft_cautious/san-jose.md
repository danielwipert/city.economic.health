## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The economic data for the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.7%, placing it in the 24th percentile nationally, which suggests a relatively tight labor market but one that is not among the tightest in the country. The labor force participation rate of 64.77% is near the national median, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Earnings growth over the past year has been negative at -0.88%, ranking at the bottom percentile, which may reflect challenges in wage growth or employment composition shifts.

Housing market indicators show a more dynamic trend. The housing price index has increased by 9.58% year-over-year, placing the region in the 62nd percentile, suggesting a robust but not overheated market. In contrast, the number of building permits has surged by 90.23% year-over-year, a figure in the 96th percentile, indicating strong construction activity. However, the pace of sales appears to have slowed, with days on market increasing to 38 days, a high percentile score that may reflect a cooling in buyer demand or an increase in inventory.

Overall, the data suggests a complex economic environment in San Jose, with some sectors showing strength while others face challenges.
