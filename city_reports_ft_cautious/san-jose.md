## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The economic data for the San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara metropolitan area indicates a mixed performance across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, placing it in the 38th percentile nationally, which suggests that while employment conditions are not among the best, they are also not particularly weak. Labor force participation is at 64.44%, ranking in the 48th percentile, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the labor market. Earnings growth over the past year has been modest, at 1.21%, placing it in the 8th percentile, which may reflect a relatively slow expansion in income levels compared to other regions.

Housing market indicators show more pronounced trends. The housing price index has increased by 9.58% year-over-year, placing the region in the 62nd percentile, suggesting a steady appreciation in home values. However, the number of building permits has surged by 211.79% year-over-year, ranking in the 98th percentile, which could indicate robust construction activity and potential supply-side responses to housing demand. In contrast, the days on market metric stands at 55 days, in the 78th percentile, suggesting a competitive but not overheated market where properties are selling at a reasonable pace.

Overall, the data suggests a balanced but not exceptional economic environment in San Jose, with some areas showing strength and others indicating more moderate performance.
