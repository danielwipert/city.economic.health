The economic landscape of San Jose-Sunnyvale-Santa Clara, as of the latest available data, presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.5%, placing it in the 26th percentile among comparable regions, which suggests a relatively stable but not particularly robust labor market. The labor force participation rate of 64.66% is in the 52nd percentile, indicating moderate engagement in the workforce. Earnings growth year-over-year is modest at 1.21%, ranking in the 8th percentile, which may reflect subdued wage pressures or broader economic conditions affecting income levels.

Housing market indicators show significant activity, with a 90.23% increase in building permits year-over-year, placing this metric in the 96th percentile. This surge in permits could indicate strong demand for new housing or commercial development. The home price index has risen by 9.58% year-over-year, in the 62nd percentile, suggesting continued appreciation in property values.

Additionally, the average days on market have increased to 43 days, in the 86th percentile, which may reflect a cooling in buyer interest or a shift in market dynamics.
