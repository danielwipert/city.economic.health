## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Salt Lake City's economic indicators present a mixed but generally positive picture. The unemployment rate stands at 3.4%, placing the city in the 76th percentile among metropolitan areas, which suggests a relatively robust labor market. The labor force participation rate of 72.77% is notably high, ranking in the 94th percentile, indicating a strong engagement of the working-age population in the economy. Year-over-year earnings growth is at 3.15%, situated in the middle of the distribution (48th percentile), while the cost of living increase of 5.31% is below average (34th percentile), potentially affecting real wage growth.

Housing market dynamics show both strength and moderation. The year-over-year increase in housing prices is 6.26%, placing the city in the 50th percentile, suggesting stable appreciation. However, the year-over-year change in permits for new housing units is up 9.65%, ranking in the 62nd percentile, which may reflect ongoing demand for new residential properties. The supply of existing homes appears constrained, with a year-over-year decline of 1.77% in the number of properties for sale (36th percentile). Additionally, the median days on market for homes is 75 days, significantly higher than the national average (26th percentile), which could indicate a more deliberate sales process or less urgency among buyers.

Overall, these indicators suggest a resilient local economy with strong labor market participation and moderate housing market activity.
