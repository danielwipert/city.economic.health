# Salt Lake City — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Salt Lake City's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The city's unemployment rate of 3.8% places it in the 74th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively strong labor market. Labour force participation stands at 72.53%, a high figure that ranks in the 94th percentile, suggesting a high level of engagement among the working-age population. Average weekly hours worked are 35.7 hours, also in the 94th percentile, further supporting this view. However, year-over-year earnings growth is modest at 1.0%, ranking in the 20th percentile, which may reflect a stable but less dynamic wage environment.

In the housing sector, Salt Lake City's home price index has increased by 6.26% year-over-year, a moderate rise that places the city in the 50th percentile. This growth is accompanied by a 36.31% increase in building permits issued year-over-year, a significant rise that ranks in the 86th percentile, suggesting continued investment in residential construction. The number of days properties remain on the market has risen to 63 days, in the 26th percentile, which could indicate a slight slowing in the pace of sales. The cost of living index is 5.51, in the 26th percentile, and the owner-occupied housing rate is 4.22, in the 94th percentile, both of which suggest a relatively affordable housing market.

Overall, Salt Lake City's economic performance appears to be above average, with strengths in labour market engagement and housing construction, though wage growth remains a point of consideration.
