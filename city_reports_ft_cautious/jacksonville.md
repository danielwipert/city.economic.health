# Jacksonville — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Jacksonville's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some areas performing relatively well and others lagging behind national trends. The city's unemployment rate stands at 4.6%, placing it in the 16th percentile among metropolitan areas, indicating a labour market that is performing below average in terms of job availability. The labour force participation rate of 60.38% also ranks in the 16th percentile, suggesting a lower proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labour market compared to other regions.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 5.0%, placing Jacksonville in the 70th percentile, a relatively strong performance. However, this is somewhat offset by a decline in housing permits, which have fallen by 2.57% year-over-year, ranking in the 48th percentile. This may reflect a slowdown in construction activity or a shift in housing demand. The city's housing market shows moderate appreciation, with home prices increasing by 5.54% year-over-year, placing it in the 46th percentile. Meanwhile, the supply of for-sale homes has decreased by 2.73% year-over-year, ranking in the 16th percentile, which could indicate tighter inventory conditions.

Overall, Jacksonville's economic profile suggests a region with stable but not robust growth, with some strengths in earnings and housing prices but challenges in employment and labour force participation.
