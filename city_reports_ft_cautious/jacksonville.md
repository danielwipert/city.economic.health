# Jacksonville — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Jacksonville's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some areas showing relative strength while others lag behind national trends. The unemployment rate stands at 5.1%, placing it in the 8th percentile among comparable metro areas, indicating a stable but not particularly robust labour market. The labour force participation rate of 60.62% is relatively low, ranking in the 16th percentile, suggesting potential underutilization of the workforce.

Earnings growth in Jacksonville has been strong, with a year-over-year increase of 10.99%, placing it in the 96th percentile. This rise in earnings may reflect improvements in the local job market or shifts in industry composition. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is at 4.33%, which is moderate and places the city in the 74th percentile. Housing prices have increased by 5.54% year-over-year, a moderate pace that ranks in the 46th percentile, suggesting a steady housing market. However, the number of building permits has grown only slightly, by 2.98%, placing it in the 64th percentile, which may indicate cautious development activity.

The city's overall economic performance, as reflected in these indicators, suggests a region with some areas of strength, particularly in earnings growth, but also facing challenges in labour market participation and potentially slower construction activity. Jacksonville's overall grade of C+ and weighted percentile of 38.6% indicate a middle-of-the-road performance compared to other metropolitan areas.
