# Jacksonville — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Jacksonville's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The city's unemployment rate stands at 4.6%, placing it in the 32nd percentile among metropolitan areas. This suggests a labour market that is neither exceptionally tight nor particularly weak. The labour force participation rate of 60.61% is relatively low, ranking in the 14th percentile. This indicates a lower proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labour market compared to other regions.

Earnings growth over the past year has been robust at 9.66%, placing Jacksonville in the 98th percentile. This is a significant strength in the current economic environment. Housing market indicators show moderate trends. The housing price index has increased by 5.54% year-over-year, placing the city in the 48th percentile. This suggests stable but not overly exuberant growth in home values. The number of building permits has declined by 2.63% year-over-year, ranking in the 46th percentile. The days on market metric stands at 76 days, well above the national average, and in the 8th percentile. This indicates a less competitive market for home sales. The cost of living index is 4.4, in the 76th percentile, suggesting that living costs in Jacksonville are higher than in many other metropolitan areas.

Overall, Jacksonville's economic performance, as indicated by these metrics, appears to be below average. Strengths in earnings growth are offset by challenges in labour market engagement and housing market dynamics.
