## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Jacksonville's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and concern. The unemployment rate stands at 4.6%, placing it in the 32nd percentile, which suggests a relatively stable labor market, though not particularly robust compared to other metropolitan areas. The labor force participation rate of 60.61% is in the 14th percentile, indicating a lower level of engagement in the workforce. Earnings growth, however, is notably strong at 9.66% year-over-year, ranking in the 98th percentile, which may reflect a tightening labor market or other local economic factors.

Housing market indicators show a complex trend. The home price index has increased by 12.27% year-over-year, placing it in the 62nd percentile, suggesting a relatively strong housing market. However, the number of building permits has decreased by 2.63% year-over-year, in the 46th percentile, which could indicate a slowdown in new construction or a shift in housing demand. The days on market for homes have increased to 76 days, in the 8th percentile, which may reflect a cooling in the pace of sales or a shift in buyer behavior.

Overall, Jacksonville's economic profile, with a weighted percentile of 41.4 and a grade of B-, suggests a below-average performance relative to other metropolitan areas, with notable strengths in earnings growth and housing prices, but challenges in labor force participation and housing market dynamics.
