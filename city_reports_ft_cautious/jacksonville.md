# Jacksonville — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Jacksonville's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and concern. The city's unemployment rate of 4.6% places it in the 32nd percentile nationally, suggesting a labour market that is neither exceptionally strong nor weak. The labour force participation rate of 60.61% ranks in the 14th percentile, indicating a lower proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labour market compared to other metropolitan areas. Earnings growth year-over-year is robust at 9.66%, placing Jacksonville in the 98th percentile, which may reflect strong wage pressures or improvements in productivity.

Housing market indicators show moderate trends. The housing price index has increased by 5.54% year-over-year, placing the city in the 48th percentile, suggesting stable but not rapid appreciation in home values. Permits for new residential construction have declined by 2.63% year-over-year, ranking in the 46th percentile, which could indicate a slowdown in new housing development. The days on market metric stands at 76 days, above the national average, and ranks in the 8th percentile, suggesting a less competitive market for home sales. The cost of living index is 4.4, placing it in the 76th percentile, indicating that living costs in Jacksonville are higher than in many other U.S. cities.

Overall, Jacksonville's economic performance appears to be below average, with strengths in earnings growth offset by weaker labour market engagement and a less dynamic housing market.
