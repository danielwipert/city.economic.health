# Jacksonville — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Jacksonville's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The city's unemployment rate stands at 5.1%, placing it in the 8th percentile nationally. This suggests a higher unemployment level compared to many other metropolitan areas. The labour force participation rate of 60.62% ranks in the 16th percentile, indicating a smaller proportion of the working-age population is either employed or actively seeking employment.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 5.0%, a figure that ranks in the 70th percentile. This suggests that those who are employed are experiencing wage increases above the national median. However, the cost of living index of 4.71 may impact the real value of these earnings gains. Housing market indicators show a year-over-year increase in home prices of 5.54%, in line with broader national trends. The number of permits issued for new housing units has declined by 2.57%, potentially reflecting a slowdown in construction activity. The days-on-market metric for homes, at 83 days, is relatively high, indicating a less active housing market.

The data suggests that Jacksonville's economic performance is characterised by both robust elements, such as earnings growth, and challenges in employment and housing market dynamics.
