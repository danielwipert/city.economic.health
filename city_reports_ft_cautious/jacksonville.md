# Jacksonville — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Jacksonville's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 5.1%, placing it in the 8th percentile nationally. This suggests a relatively high level of joblessness compared to other metropolitan areas. The labour force participation rate of 60.62% is below average, ranking in the 16th percentile.

On a more positive note, earnings growth over the past year has been 10.99%, placing Jacksonville in the 96th percentile. This contrasts with a modest 4.33% increase in the cost of living, which places the city in the 74th percentile. The cost of living increase may reflect a favorable environment for real wage growth.

Housing market indicators show a 5.54% year-over-year increase in home prices, ranking in the 46th percentile. The number of housing permits issued has declined by 2.57% year-over-year, placing the city in the 48th percentile. This decline in permits may indicate a slowdown in new residential construction.

Overall, Jacksonville's economic performance, as reflected in these indicators, suggests a region with strong wage growth but facing challenges in employment and labour force participation. The housing market appears stable, though not particularly dynamic.
