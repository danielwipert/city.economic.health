# Jacksonville — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Jacksonville's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and concern. The city's unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, placing it in the 30th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively stable labour market. The labour force participation rate of 60.83% ranks in the 20th percentile, suggesting a lower proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labour force.

Earnings growth in Jacksonville has been strong, with a year-over-year increase of 9.59%, placing it in the 96th percentile. This rise in earnings may reflect improvements in the local economy or shifts in the composition of employment. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is at 4.4%, in line with broader national trends. Housing market indicators show a year-over-year increase in home prices of 5.54%, while properties remain on the market for 78 days, suggesting a balanced market.

Construction activity appears to be moderating, with a 2.63% decline in building permits. This may reflect a cooling in demand or regulatory constraints. Overall, Jacksonville's economic performance, as reflected in these indicators, suggests a market with some positive momentum in earnings and price stability, but also challenges in labour force engagement and construction activity.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Jacksonville's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and concern. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, placing it in the 30th percentile nationally, which suggests a relatively stable labor market but not one that is particularly robust compared to other metropolitan areas. The labor force participation rate of 60.83% is also below average, ranking in the 20th percentile, indicating a lower proportion of the working-age population is engaged in the labor force.

Earnings growth in Jacksonville has been notably strong, with a year-over-year increase of 9.59%, placing it in the 96th percentile. This significant rise in earnings may reflect improvements in the local economy or shifts in the composition of employment. Inflation, as measured by the cost of living index, is at 4.4%, which is moderate and aligns with broader national trends. Housing market indicators show a year-over-year increase in home prices of 5.54%, while the number of days properties remain on the market is 78 days, suggesting a balanced but not overly dynamic housing market. Construction activity, as indicated by a 2.63% decline in building permits, appears to be moderating, which may reflect a cooling in demand or regulatory constraints.

Overall, Jacksonville's economic performance, as reflected in these indicators, suggests a market with some positive momentum in earnings and price stability, but also challenges in labor force engagement and construction activity.
