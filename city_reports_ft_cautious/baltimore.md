The Baltimore-Columbia-Towson metropolitan area ranks 22nd among U.S. metro areas, with a weighted percentile score of 39.5, placing it in the lower half of the national distribution. The unemployment rate stands at 4.6%, which is slightly above the median when compared to other metro areas, as indicated by its 24th percentile ranking. Labor force participation is at 64.55%, aligning closely with the national median, suggesting a stable but not particularly robust labor market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been modest, increasing by 2.16%, placing the region in the 18th percentile. This slow growth may reflect broader economic conditions or specific local factors, though the data does not provide clear causality. Housing prices have risen by 14.35% year-over-year, a significant increase that places the region in the 72nd percentile, indicating a relatively strong housing market. However, this contrasts with a decline in building permits, down 27.64% year-over-year, which is in the 8th percentile, suggesting a potential slowdown in new construction activity.

Overall, the data suggests a mixed economic picture for Baltimore, with some indicators showing strength while others point to areas of concern.
