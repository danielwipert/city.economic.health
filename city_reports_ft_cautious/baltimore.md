# Baltimore — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Baltimore-Columbia-Towson metropolitan area's economic data, as of the latest available figures, presents a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, slightly above the national average, and the labour force participation rate is 64.9%, ranking in the 58th percentile among similar regions. Year-over-year earnings growth is 2.1%, placing it in the 22nd percentile, which may reflect a slower pace of wage increases compared to other areas. The cost of living index is 5.19, and the overall wage replacement rate is 2.92, both of which are within the middle range of national comparisons.

In the housing market, the year-over-year change in housing prices is 13.42%, placing Baltimore in the 64th percentile. However, the year-over-year change in permits for new residential construction has declined by 32.0%, indicating a slowdown in new housing development. The days on market for properties is 41.0, which is relatively low, suggesting strong demand for existing homes. The year-over-year change in the price of single-family homes is 2.48%, ranking in the 86th percentile, indicating steady appreciation in home values.

These data points collectively indicate a below-average economic performance, with some notable strengths in housing market dynamics and labour force participation, but also challenges in wage growth and new construction activity.
