# Baltimore — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Baltimore-Columbia-Towson metropolitan area's economic landscape, as of the latest available data, presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, placing it in the 30th percentile nationally, indicating a labour market that is performing below the national average but remains relatively stable. Labour force participation is at 64.61%, aligning with the national median, suggesting a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Year-over-year earnings growth is 0.74%, ranking in the 16th percentile, which may reflect a slower pace of wage increases compared to other regions.

Housing market indicators show contrasting trends. The year-over-year change in housing permits has declined by 32%, placing the region in the 12th percentile, suggesting a slowdown in new residential construction. Conversely, the housing price index has risen by 14.35% over the same period, ranking in the 72nd percentile, indicating robust appreciation in home values. The days on market metric stands at 45 days, in the 74th percentile, suggesting a relatively quick turnover in the housing market despite the decline in new construction permits.

The data suggests a regional economy with stable employment and labour participation, modest wage growth, and a housing market characterised by strong price appreciation but reduced new construction activity. The weighted percentile score of 40.9 and a grade of B- indicate an overall performance that is below average relative to other metropolitan areas.
