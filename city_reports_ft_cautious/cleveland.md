# Cleveland — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Cleveland's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The unemployment rate of 3.4% places the city in the 90th percentile among comparable metropolitan areas, indicating a relatively robust labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 58.01% is in the 2nd percentile, suggesting a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labour market.

Year-over-year earnings growth is 1.36%, ranking in the 10th percentile. This may reflect a slower pace of wage increases compared to other regions. In the housing sector, Cleveland's home price index has increased by 4.0% year-over-year, placing it in the 38th percentile. The number of building permits issued has risen by 14.96% year-over-year, a figure in the 78th percentile. The days on market metric stands at 55 days, in the 48th percentile.

Overall, Cleveland's economic performance appears to be average, with some indicators pointing to strengths in employment and housing construction, while others highlight challenges in labour force participation and wage growth.
