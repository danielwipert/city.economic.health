The metropolitan area's unemployment rate stands at 3.4%, placing it in the 80th percentile among similar areas, suggesting a relatively robust labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 58.01% is low, ranking in the 2nd percentile, indicating a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labour market.
