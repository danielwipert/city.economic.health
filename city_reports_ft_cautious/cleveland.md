# Cleveland — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Cleveland's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some areas showing relative strength while others lag behind national trends. The unemployment rate stands at 3.4%, placing it in the 88th percentile among metropolitan areas, suggesting a relatively tight labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 58.01% is in the 2nd percentile, indicating a lower engagement of the working-age population in the labor market compared to other regions.

Earnings growth has been negative, declining by 1.84% year-over-year, which ranks at the bottom of the distribution (0th percentile). This may reflect challenges in wage growth or employment composition. In contrast, the housing sector has seen a 4.1% increase in home prices year-over-year, placing it in the 40th percentile, a moderate pace of appreciation.

Building permits have risen by 14.96% year-over-year, a significant increase that places the city in the 74th percentile, suggesting ongoing investment in residential construction. The pace of sales, as indicated by the 55 days on the market, is in the 78th percentile, indicating a relatively active market. Cleveland's overall economic performance is average, with a weighted percentile score of 55.3 and a grade of "B" relative to other metropolitan areas.
