# Cleveland — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Cleveland's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 3.4%, placing it in the 88th percentile among comparable regions. This suggests a relatively robust labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 58.01% is low, ranking in the 2nd percentile. This indicates that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labour market.

Earnings growth has been negative, with a year-over-year decrease of 1.79%. Cleveland ranks at the bottom of the rankings in this category. The decline in earnings may be related to broader economic challenges or sector-specific issues within the region.

On the housing front, Cleveland shows some positive trends. The year-over-year increase in housing permits is 14.96%, placing it in the 70th percentile. This suggests a moderate level of construction activity. The home price index has risen by 3.37% over the past year, ranking in the 36th percentile. This indicates stable but not particularly strong appreciation. The rental market appears to be more dynamic, with a 12.86% increase in the price of single-family rentals, placing Cleveland in the 98th percentile. This suggests high demand for rental properties, possibly driven by demographic shifts or economic factors affecting homeownership. The average days on market for homes is 55 days, which is in the 78th percentile. This indicates a relatively quick turnover in the housing market.

Overall, Cleveland's economic performance is characterised by a strong labour market and active rental sector, offset by low labour force participation and declining earnings. The data suggests a complex economic landscape that may require further analysis to understand fully.
