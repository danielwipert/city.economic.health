## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Cleveland's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and challenges. The unemployment rate stands at 3.4%, placing it in the 76th percentile among metropolitan areas, suggesting a relatively robust labor market. However, the labor force participation rate of 58.01% is significantly lower, ranking in the 2nd percentile, which may indicate a smaller proportion of the working-age population actively engaged in the labor market. Real earnings have declined year-over-year by 1.79%, placing Cleveland at the bottom of the percentile rankings in this category, indicating a potential decline in purchasing power for workers.

In the housing sector, Cleveland shows some positive trends. The year-over-year increase in housing prices of 3.37% and a 12.86% rise in permits for new residential construction suggest ongoing demand and investment in the housing market. The median days on market for homes has increased to 55 days, which is in the 92nd percentile, possibly reflecting a more balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers dominate. These housing metrics contrast with the weaker labor market indicators, highlighting the diverse nature of Cleveland's economic landscape.

Overall, Cleveland's economic performance appears average, with strengths in housing and employment but challenges in labor force participation and real earnings growth.
