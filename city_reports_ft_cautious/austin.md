# Austin — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 3.9%, slightly above the national average but still relatively low by historical standards. The labour force participation rate of 73.46% is high, placing it in the 96th percentile among comparable regions. Year-over-year earnings growth is 5.02%, a moderate increase in income levels, though this figure is in the 62nd percentile, indicating it is not outpacing many other regions.

On the housing front, data shows a decline in both home prices and construction activity. The year-over-year change in the housing price index is down 10.3%, and building permits have decreased by 37.08% compared with the previous year. These figures are in the lowest percentiles, at 0 and 6 respectively, indicating a slowdown in the real estate sector. The days-on-market metric has risen to 80 days, up from lower levels, which may reflect a change in buyer demand or an oversupply of properties.

The data suggests that while Austin's labour market remains strong, the housing sector is experiencing a downturn. The weighted percentile score is 50.3 and the grade is B, indicating an average performance across the board.
