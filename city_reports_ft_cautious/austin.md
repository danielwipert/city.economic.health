## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The unemployment rate of 3.5% places it in the 86th percentile among comparable regions, indicating a relatively robust labour market. The labour force participation rate of 74.47% is high, ranking in the 96th percentile, suggesting a strong engagement of the working-age population in the economy. Earnings growth year-over-year is 3.18%, aligning with the national average as reflected by its 50th percentile score.

In the housing sector, the data shows some challenges. The year-over-year change in housing prices has declined by 10.3%, placing it at the 0th percentile. Similarly, the year-over-year change in permits for new residential construction has decreased by 19.54%, ranking in the 18th percentile.
