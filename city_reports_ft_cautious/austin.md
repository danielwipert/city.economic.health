# Austin — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos metropolitan area's economic data shows a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate of 3.5% places it in the 86th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively robust labour market. The labour force participation rate of 74.47% ranks in the 96th percentile, suggesting a high level of workforce engagement. However, year-over-year earnings growth of 5.67% is more moderate, sitting in the 60th percentile, which may reflect a broader trend in wage growth.

In the housing sector, several key metrics have declined. Building permits have fallen by 19.54% year-over-year, and the housing price index has dropped by 10.3%, both of which are at the lower end of the national spectrum, with percentiles of 18 and 0, respectively. This suggests a cooling in the construction and real estate markets. The days on market for properties have increased to 88 days, also at the 0th percentile, which may indicate a slowdown in property sales activity. Average weekly hours worked remain steady at 35.5 hours, aligning with the 86th percentile, suggesting stability in employment duration.

The data presents a picture of an economy with strong labour market fundamentals but facing challenges in the housing sector.
