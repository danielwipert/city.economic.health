# Austin — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Austin's economic data presents a mixed picture. The metropolitan area's unemployment rate stands at 3.8%, placing it in the 64th percentile nationally. This suggests a relatively low level of joblessness compared to other regions. The labour force participation rate is 73.89%, ranking in the 96th percentile, indicating a high level of engagement of the working-age population in the labour market. Weekly hours worked average 35.2 hours, a figure that ranks in the 84th percentile, further indicating strong labour market conditions.

In terms of earnings and cost of living, the year-over-year growth in earnings is 2.84%, placing it in the 42nd percentile. The cost of living index is 4.97, in the 52nd percentile, indicating moderate growth in both areas. However, the housing market is showing signs of cooling. Building permits have declined by 37.08% year-over-year, and home prices have decreased by 10.3% year-over-year. Both figures rank in the lower percentiles (6th and 0th, respectively). Days on market for homes have increased to 81 days, up from previous levels, which may reflect a shift towards a more balanced market.

The data suggests a labour market that remains strong but a housing sector that is experiencing a downturn. Austin's economic performance is below average relative to other metropolitan areas, with a weighted score of 46 and a grade of B-.
