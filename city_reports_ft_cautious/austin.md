# Austin — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos metropolitan area's economic data presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate stands at 3.9%, placing it in the 70th percentile among comparable regions, indicating a relatively robust labour market. The labour force participation rate of 73.46% ranks higher at the 96th percentile, suggesting a high level of engagement in the workforce. However, earnings growth year-over-year is modest at 2.84%, ranking in the 42nd percentile, which may reflect a slowdown in wage increases.

Housing and construction metrics show declines. Building permits have decreased by 37.08% year-over-year, placing the region in the 6th percentile. The housing price index has fallen by 10.3% year-over-year, ranking at the bottom percentile, and the price-to-rent ratio has dropped by 4.52%, also in the lower percentiles. The average days on market for properties has increased to 81 days, indicating a less dynamic real estate sector.

The data suggests that while Austin's labour market remains strong, the housing sector faces challenges. The weighted percentile score of 46.5 and the grade of B- reflect a below-average performance across the board.
