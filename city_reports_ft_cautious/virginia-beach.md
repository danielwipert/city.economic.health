# Virginia Beach — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Virginia Beach-Chesapeake-Norfolk metropolitan area ranks 37th in the dataset, with an overall grade of B, indicating average performance across various economic indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 3.6%, placing it at the 50th percentile, suggesting a labour market that is neither particularly strong nor weak compared to other regions. The labour force participation rate of 58.99% is low, ranking in the 4th percentile, which may reflect challenges in engaging the local workforce or structural issues within the labour market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 10.22%, placing the region in the 98th percentile. This rise in earnings is a positive signal, although it is worth noting that it does not necessarily translate into improved living standards if not accompanied by corresponding increases in productivity or decreases in costs. The cost of living has increased by 4.52%, which, while moderate, could impact the real value of these earnings gains. Housing prices have risen by 18.58% year-over-year, a substantial increase that places the region in the 84th percentile, suggesting a strong housing market but also potential affordability concerns.

Permits for new residential construction have decreased by 7.61% year-over-year, which may indicate a slowdown in the housing market or a response to existing supply and demand dynamics. The number of days properties remain on the market has stabilised at 57 days, a figure that is relatively high but not unusual given the broader context. The data presents a mixed economic picture for Virginia Beach, with strengths in earnings growth and housing appreciation, but challenges in labour force participation and potentially in the housing market.
