# Virginia Beach — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Virginia Beach-Chesapeake-Norfolk metropolitan area received a grade of B in a recent economic assessment, ranking 37th overall. The area's unemployment rate stands at 4.0%, slightly above the median percentile score of 48.0. This suggests a labour market that is neither particularly strong nor weak compared to other regions. The labour force participation rate of 58.9% is low, placing it in the 4th percentile, which may indicate challenges in engaging the local workforce or structural issues within the labour market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 10.22%, placing the region in the 98th percentile. This growth contrasts with a modest increase in consumer prices, which rose by 4.52%, placing the region in the 68th percentile. The cost of living adjustment appears to be outpaced by wage growth, potentially improving real incomes for residents. Housing market indicators show a mixed picture: housing prices have increased by 18.58% year-over-year, placing the region in the 84th percentile, while the number of building permits has declined by 7.61%, in the 38th percentile. The days on market for homes have increased to 51 days, in the 92nd percentile, suggesting a cooling in the pace of home sales.

The data suggests a regional economy with strong wage growth and stable employment, but with some signs of cooling in the housing market and low labour force participation.
