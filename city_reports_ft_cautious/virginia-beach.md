The unemployment rate is 4.0%, placing it in the 66th percentile, suggesting a relatively stable labor market.

Year-over-year earnings growth is 8.75%, ranking in the 92nd percentile. This may reflect strong wage pressures or improvements in productivity. Housing market indicators show mixed trends. The year-over-year increase in housing prices is 18.58%, placing it in the 84th percentile, suggesting a strong demand for housing in the area. However, the year-over-year change in permits for new housing units is 5.26%, in the 60th percentile, which could indicate a more moderate pace of new construction relative to demand.

The cost of living index is 4.56, in the 72nd percentile, and the owner-occupied housing rate is 1.94, in the 28th percentile. These figures suggest moderate affordability challenges. Weekly hours worked average 33.1 hours, in the 4th percentile, which may reflect part-time employment or flexible work arrangements.

The data suggests a region with a stable but not exceptionally strong labor market, robust earnings growth, and a housing market characterized by strong price appreciation but moderate new construction activity.
