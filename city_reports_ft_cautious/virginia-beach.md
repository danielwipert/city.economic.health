# Virginia Beach — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

Virginia Beach's economic landscape, as part of the Virginia Beach-Chesapeake-Norfolk metropolitan area, presents a mixed picture according to recent data. The unemployment rate stands at 3.5%, placing it in the 76th percentile among similar regions, indicating a relatively strong labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 59.3% is lower, ranking in the 4th percentile, suggesting a potential underutilisation of the workforce.

Earnings growth year-over-year is 10.68%, ranking in the 98th percentile, which may reflect a tightening labour market or sector-specific wage pressures. The year-over-year increase in home prices of 18.58% places the region in the 84th percentile, suggesting continued demand for residential properties. This is supported by a 5.26% increase in building permits, which ranks in the 60th percentile, indicating ongoing construction activity.

The cost of living index of 4.53, in the 64th percentile, and the owner-occupied housing costs of 1.88, in the 28th percentile, suggest moderate affordability challenges. Weekly hours worked, at 33.1 hours, rank in the 10th percentile, which may indicate flexible work arrangements or part-time employment trends.

The data suggests a region with strong earnings growth and housing demand, but also highlights areas of concern, including low labour force participation and potentially limited full-time employment opportunities.
