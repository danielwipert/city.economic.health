The Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metropolitan area ranks 17th in a recent economic assessment, with a weighted percentile score of 41.8, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate stands at 4.6%, which is relatively low but places the region in the 16th percentile among comparable areas. The labor force participation rate of 59.95% is also below average, ranking in the 6th percentile. These figures suggest a labor market that, while not under severe strain, may have room for improvement in terms of employment opportunities and workforce engagement.

Earnings growth year-over-year is reported at 4.86%, a figure that ranks in the 68th percentile, indicating a moderate level of income expansion. The cost of living increase of 5.25% is slightly above the earnings growth, placing it in the 36th percentile, which may reflect a modest pressure on household budgets. Housing market indicators show a mixed picture: building permits have increased by 71.38% year-over-year, a significant rise that ranks in the 94th percentile, suggesting robust construction activity. However, the housing price index has declined by 3.84% over the same period, placing it in the 2nd percentile, which could indicate a cooling in the housing market. The days on market for properties have increased to 85 days, ranking in the 8th percentile, further suggesting a slowdown in property sales.

Overall, the data indicates a metropolitan area with a stable but not particularly dynamic economy, characterized by moderate growth in earnings and construction activity, offset by a softening in the housing market and relatively low labor force participation.
