# Tampa — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metropolitan area ranked 17th in a recent economic assessment, with a weighted percentile of 47.2, corresponding to a grade of B-, described as "Below Average." The unemployment rate stood at 4.4%, placing it at the 42nd percentile, indicating a labour market that is neither particularly strong nor weak compared to other metropolitan areas. The labour force participation rate was 60.12%, ranking in the 10th percentile, suggesting a relatively low level of engagement in the labour market.

Earnings growth over the past year was 8.64%, placing the region in the 88th percentile, a notable positive. The cost of living has increased by 4.68%, placing it in the 66th percentile, suggesting that while earnings are growing, the cost of living is also rising. Housing indicators show a mixed picture: the housing price index has decreased by 3.34% year-over-year, placing the region in the 2nd percentile, while the number of building permits has increased by 10.06%, in the 66th percentile, indicating ongoing construction activity despite the decline in housing prices. The number of days on the market for properties was 79 days, in the 6th percentile, which may reflect a cooling in the housing market.

The data suggests a mixed economic environment in Tampa, with strong earnings growth and continued construction activity, but also challenges in labour force participation and housing market dynamics.
