## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metropolitan area ranks 17th in a recent economic assessment, with a weighted percentile score of 44.7, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, which is relatively low but places the region in the 30th percentile nationally, suggesting a labor market that is performing modestly compared to other regions. The labor force participation rate of 60.34% is also below the national average, indicating a potentially underutilized workforce.

Earnings growth over the past year has been robust, increasing by 8.3%, placing Tampa in the 82nd percentile for this metric. This suggests a positive trend in income levels, which may reflect broader economic strength or specific sectoral performance. Housing indicators present a mixed picture: while housing prices have declined by 4.16% year-over-year, the number of building permits has increased by 10.06%, suggesting continued investment in residential construction despite the price drop. The median days on market for homes is 78 days, which is relatively high and may indicate a cooling in the housing market.

Overall, the data indicates a region with solid earnings growth and ongoing construction activity, but with labor market participation and housing metrics that suggest caution.
