Housing market indicators show a mixed picture. The number of building permits issued has increased by 71.38% year-over-year, suggesting construction activity remains robust. Conversely, the housing price index has declined by 3.84% over the same period, which may indicate a cooling in the housing market.

The Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metropolitan area ranks 17th in a recent economic assessment, with a weighted percentile score of 41.8, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate stands at 5.0%, which is slightly above the national average, and the labor force participation rate is 60.0%, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Earnings growth over the past year has been positive at 4.86%, aligning with broader trends of wage increases across the country.

Housing market indicators present a mixed picture. The number of building permits issued has increased by 71.38% year-over-year, suggesting robust construction activity. Conversely, the housing price index has declined by 3.84% over the same period, which may reflect a cooling in the housing market. The median days on market for homes has lengthened to 80 days, up from previous levels, further indicating a slowdown in sales velocity. Rental prices have risen modestly by 0.82% year-over-year, while the owner-occupied housing rate stands at 3.08%, which is relatively low compared to other metrics.

Overall, the data suggests that while Tampa's economy is experiencing some positive trends in employment and construction, challenges persist in the housing market and cost of living.
