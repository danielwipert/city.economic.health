The median days on market for homes is 78 days, a relatively high figure that may indicate a slowdown in sales activity.

The Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metropolitan area ranks 17th in a recent economic assessment, with a weighted percentile score of 44, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, which is relatively low but places the region in the 30th percentile among comparable areas. The labor force participation rate is 60.34%, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce, though this figure is in the lower 10th percentile, suggesting potential underutilization of the labor market.

Earnings growth over the past year has been robust, increasing by 9.51%, which is significantly higher than most other regions, placing Tampa in the 94th percentile. However, the cost of living has also risen by 4.63%, which may offset some of the gains in earnings. Housing market indicators show mixed signals: while building permits have increased by 10.06% year-over-year, home prices have declined by 4.16% over the same period. This suggests a complex dynamic in the housing sector, possibly reflecting a balance between supply and demand. The median days on market for homes is 78 days, which is relatively high and may indicate a slowdown in sales activity.

Overall, the data indicates a mixed economic performance in Tampa, with strong earnings growth and a healthy job market, but also signs of labor market underutilization and a cooling housing market.
