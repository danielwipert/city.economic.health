# Tampa — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metropolitan area ranks 17th in a recent economic assessment, with a weighted percentile of 45.8, corresponding to a grade of B-, described as "Below Average." The data presents a mixed economic picture, with some areas showing strength and others lagging behind.

The unemployment rate stands at 4.4%, placing it at the 42nd percentile, indicating a labour market that is neither particularly strong nor weak compared to other regions. The labour force participation rate of 60.12% is low, ranking in the 10th percentile, which may be influenced by broader demographic or economic factors. Earnings growth over the past year is 9.51%, placing it in the 94th percentile, indicating a significant increase in income levels. However, the cost of living has also risen, with a year-over-year increase of 4.63%, placing it in the 62nd percentile, which may offset some of the gains in earnings.

Housing market indicators are varied. The year-over-year change in housing permits is positive at 10.06%, ranking in the 66th percentile, suggesting ongoing construction activity. However, the housing price index has declined by 4.14% over the same period, placing it in the 2nd percentile, which may indicate a cooling in the housing market. The median days on market for homes is 78 days, a relatively high figure in the 6th percentile, which could suggest a slowdown in sales activity. The year-over-year change in the price per square foot is a modest 0.41%, ranking in the 68th percentile, indicating stable but not particularly dynamic price movements.

The data suggests a region with some areas of economic strength, including earnings growth and construction activity, but also facing challenges in labour force participation and housing market dynamics.
