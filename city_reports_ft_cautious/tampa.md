## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metropolitan area ranks 17th in a recent economic assessment, with a weighted percentile score of 42.7, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate stands at 5.0%, which is slightly above the national average, and the labor force participation rate is 60.0%, indicating a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Earnings growth over the past year has been robust, increasing by 8.3%, a figure that places the region in the 82nd percentile among similar areas. This suggests that despite a relatively high unemployment rate, those who are employed are experiencing significant wage gains.

Housing market indicators present a mixed picture. The housing price index has declined by 4.16% year-over-year, placing the region in the 2nd percentile, which may reflect a cooling market or a correction from previous increases. In contrast, the number of building permits issued has risen by 15.91% year-over-year, a figure in the 78th percentile, suggesting continued investment in residential construction. The median days on market for homes is 80 days, which is relatively high and may indicate a slowdown in sales activity. The cost of living index stands at 4.79, near the median, while the overall well-being ranking is 3.26, also near the middle of the distribution, indicating that the cost of living and quality of life are neither particularly high nor low compared to other regions.

These data points suggest a complex economic landscape in Tampa, characterized by strong earnings growth and ongoing construction activity, but also by higher unemployment and a cooling housing market.
