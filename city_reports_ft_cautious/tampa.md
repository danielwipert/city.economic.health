# Tampa — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metropolitan area, ranked 17th, presents a mixed economic picture according to the latest available data. The unemployment rate stands at 4.3%, placing it in the 30th percentile, indicating a labour market that is neither particularly strong nor weak compared to other metropolitan areas. The labour force participation rate of 60.34% is in the 10th percentile, suggesting a relatively low level of engagement in the workforce. Earnings growth over the past year has been significant, with a 9.51% increase, placing the region in the 94th percentile. The cost of living has risen by 4.63%, situating it in the 62nd percentile, which may reflect broader inflationary pressures affecting the area. The average weekly hours worked, at 34.2, are in the 52nd percentile, suggesting a moderate level of work activity.

Housing market indicators show a more complex picture. The year-over-year change in housing prices has declined by 4.14%, placing the region in the 2nd percentile, which could indicate a cooling market. The number of days a property remains on the market is 78, in the 6th percentile, suggesting a slower pace of sales. Building permits have increased by 10.06% year-over-year, placing the region in the 66th percentile, indicating ongoing construction activity. The price-to-square-foot ratio has risen by 0.41%, in the 68th percentile, which may reflect stable or slightly increasing demand for housing. Overall, the weighted percentile score of 44 and a grade of B- suggest that Tampa's economic performance is below average relative to other metropolitan areas, with strengths in earnings growth and construction activity offset by lower labour force participation and a cooling housing market.

These data points illustrate a balanced but not outstanding economic environment in Tampa, with some areas of strength and others of concern.
