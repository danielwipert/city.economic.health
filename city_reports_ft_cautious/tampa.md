## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

The Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metropolitan area ranks 17th in a recent economic assessment, with a weighted percentile score of 47.2, placing it in the "Below Average" category. The unemployment rate stands at 4.4%, which is slightly above the national average, and the labor force participation rate is 60.12%, indicating a relatively low engagement in the workforce compared to other metropolitan areas. Earnings growth over the past year has been robust, increasing by 8.64%, which places Tampa in the 88th percentile for this metric. However, the cost of living has also risen by 4.68%, suggesting that wage gains may be partially offset by higher living costs.

Housing market indicators present a mixed picture. Building permits have increased by 10.06% year-over-year, reflecting continued interest in construction and development. However, the housing price index has declined by 4.14% over the same period, which may indicate cooling demand or an oversupply of homes. The days on market metric stands at 79 days, significantly higher than the national average, further suggesting a slowdown in the pace of home sales. Additionally, the median sales price of existing homes has decreased by 0.4% year-over-year, adding to the evidence of a softening market.

These data points suggest a complex economic landscape in Tampa, characterized by strong earnings growth but tempered by rising living costs and a cooling housing market.
