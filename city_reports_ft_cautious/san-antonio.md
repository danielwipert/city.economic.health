The unemployment rate stands at 4.4%, placing it in the 42nd percentile nationally, indicating a moderate level of labour market activity. The labour force participation rate of 62.92% is relatively low, ranking in the 28th percentile, suggesting a potential underutilization of the workforce.

Housing and construction indicators present a more complex picture. Building permits have declined by 36.19% year-over-year, a significant drop that places the region in the 8th percentile, reflecting a slowdown in residential construction. The housing price index has increased by 3.43% year-over-year, a moderate rise that ranks in the 34th percentile. The supply of homes on the market has decreased by 3.3%, placing the region in the 14th percentile, which may indicate a reduction in inventory.

The data suggests that San Antonio-New Braunfels exhibits both areas of economic strength and challenges. While earnings growth is a notable aspect, the region also faces challenges in labour force participation and housing market dynamics.
