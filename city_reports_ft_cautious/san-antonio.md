# San Antonio — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The economic data for the San Antonio-New Braunfels metropolitan area presents a mixed picture. The unemployment rate is 4.0%, slightly above the national average and ranking in the 48th percentile among comparable regions. Labour force participation is at 63.1%, a figure that ranks in the 30th percentile, indicating a relatively low engagement of the working-age population in the labour market. Year-over-year earnings growth is 1.78%, ranking in the 32nd percentile, which may reflect a stable but not particularly dynamic job market.

Housing and construction metrics show significant shifts. Building permits have declined by 49.04% year-over-year, placing San Antonio in the lowest percentile for this indicator. This decline could be indicative of a slowdown in residential construction activity. The housing price index has increased by 3.43% over the same period, a moderate rise that places the region in the 38th percentile. However, the pace of sales has slowed, with days on market increasing to 78 days, a figure that ranks in the 14th percentile, suggesting a less active real estate market. The cost of living index is 4.84, which is relatively high, ranking in the 54th percentile, potentially affecting the affordability of living in the area.

The weighted percentile score of 34.7 and the grade of C+ suggest that San Antonio's economy is performing below average compared to other metropolitan areas, with particular weaknesses in construction and housing market activity.
