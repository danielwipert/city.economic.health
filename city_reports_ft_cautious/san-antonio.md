## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The San Antonio-New Braunfels metropolitan area's economic data, based on the latest available figures, presents a mixed picture across various indicators. The unemployment rate stands at 4.2%, placing it in the 38th percentile nationally, indicating a labour market that is neither particularly strong nor weak compared to other regions. The labour force participation rate is 63.01%, ranking in the 30th percentile, suggesting a moderate level of engagement in the workforce. Earnings growth over the past year has been 4.9%, a figure that ranks in the 74th percentile, indicating relatively robust wage growth compared to other metropolitan areas. The cost of living index is 4.44, placing it in the 70th percentile, which may reflect a moderate cost of living relative to other cities. The average weekly hours worked is 35.5, a high 90th percentile ranking, indicating that workers in San Antonio are putting in more hours compared to their peers in other regions.

Housing and construction indicators show variability. Building permits have declined by 36.19% year-over-year, a significant drop that places the area in the 8th percentile, indicating a notable slowdown in new construction activity. The housing price index has increased by 3.43% over the same period, a moderate rise that ranks in the 34th percentile, suggesting a stable but not rapidly growing housing market. The price-to-square-foot ratio has decreased by 3.5%, placing it in the 8th percentile, which may reflect a softening in housing prices. Properties are taking 71 days on average to sell, a figure in the 12th percentile, suggesting a slower market for real estate transactions. The weighted percentile score of 40.8 and a grade of B- indicate that San Antonio's economic performance is below average relative to other metropolitan areas, with strengths in earnings growth and hours worked, but weaknesses in labour market participation and housing activity.

The data suggests a balanced but not particularly dynamic economic environment in San Antonio.
