# San Antonio — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

San Antonio-New Braunfels' economic data reveals a mixed picture across various indicators. The metropolitan area's unemployment rate of 4.4% places it at the 42nd percentile nationally, suggesting a labour market that is neither particularly strong nor weak compared to other areas. The labour force participation rate of 62.92% ranks in the 28th percentile, which may be influenced by broader demographic or regional trends affecting workforce engagement.

Earnings growth over the past year has been 5.09%, placing San Antonio in the 64th percentile, indicating moderate wage increases. However, the cost of living increase of 4.5% and the out-of-work ratio of 2.08% suggest that earnings growth is occurring in an environment where living costs are also rising. The weekly hours worked, at 35.7 hours, are high, ranking in the 94th percentile, which could be indicative of robust employment conditions or a need for workers to work longer hours.

Housing and construction indicators present a less positive picture. Building permits have declined by 36.19% year-over-year, placing the region in the 8th percentile, which may reflect a slowdown in new residential construction. Home price appreciation, at 3.43%, is modest and ranks in the 34th percentile, while the supply of homes for sale has decreased by 3.3%, ranking in the 14th percentile. The median days on market for homes is 74 days, which is relatively high and places the region in the 10th percentile, suggesting a less dynamic housing market.

Overall, the data suggests a region with stable but not exceptional economic performance, with some areas showing signs of moderation or decline.
