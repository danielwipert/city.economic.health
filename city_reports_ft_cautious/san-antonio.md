## Polished, cautious FT-style column

The unemployment rate is 4.4%, placing it at the 42nd percentile nationally, indicating a moderate level of labour market activity. The labour force participation rate of 62.92% is relatively low, ranking in the 28th percentile, suggesting that a significant portion of the working-age population is not actively engaged in the labour market. Earnings growth over the past year has been 4.9%, placing the region in the 74th percentile, which may reflect a strengthening income environment for those employed.

Housing market indicators present a nuanced picture. The year-over-year change in housing prices is 3.43%, a moderate increase that places the region in the 34th percentile. However, the number of building permits issued has declined by 36.19% year-over-year, indicating a slowdown in new construction activity. This decline is reflected in the 8th percentile ranking for this indicator, suggesting a potential cooling in the housing market. The days on market for properties have increased to 71 days, up from previous levels, which may indicate a softening demand in the real estate sector.

The data suggests that San Antonio-New Braunfels is experiencing some positive trends in employment and earnings, but also shows signs of moderation in the housing market and labour force participation.
