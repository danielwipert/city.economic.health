## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Columbus's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some metrics suggesting relative strength while others indicate more moderate performance. The unemployment rate stands at 3.9%, placing it in the 54th percentile among comparable metropolitan areas, which suggests a labor market that is performing slightly above average but not exceptionally strong. The labor force participation rate of 65.93% is in the 66th percentile, indicating a relatively high engagement of the working-age population in the labor market. Earnings growth year-over-year is at 2.91%, ranking in the 24th percentile, which may reflect a slower pace of wage increases compared to other regions.

In the housing sector, the year-over-year increase in home prices of 16.76% places Columbus in the 80th percentile, suggesting a robust housing market. However, the year-over-year change in permits for new private housing units is only 1.32%, in the 50th percentile, which could indicate a more stable or possibly constrained construction market. The median days on market for homes is 49 days, in the 62nd percentile, suggesting a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a significant advantage. The overall weighted score of 56 and a grade of B further indicate an average performance across the board.

These data points suggest that Columbus's economy is performing in line with national trends, with strengths in housing prices and labor force participation, but with more moderate performance in earnings growth and construction activity.
