## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

Columbus's economic indicators present a mixed but generally stable picture. The unemployment rate stands at 4.7%, placing it in the 24th percentile among comparable metropolitan areas, which suggests a relatively tight labor market. The labor force participation rate of 66.13% ranks in the 70th percentile, indicating a robust engagement of the working-age population in the labor market. Year-over-year earnings growth is modest at 2.26%, placing it in the 32nd percentile, which may reflect broader economic conditions rather than specific local factors.

In the housing sector, Columbus has seen a significant year-over-year increase in home prices of 16.76%, ranking in the 80th percentile, suggesting a strong demand for housing. However, the year-over-year change in permits for new private housing units is only 1.32%, in the 50th percentile, which could indicate a more moderate pace of new construction relative to other markets. The number of days properties remain on the market is 49 days, in the 62nd percentile, suggesting a balanced market where neither buyers nor sellers have a significant advantage.

Overall, Columbus's economic performance appears average, with strengths in labor force participation and home price appreciation, but with more moderate indicators in employment, earnings growth, and new construction.
