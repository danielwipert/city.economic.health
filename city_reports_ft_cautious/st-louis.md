# St. Louis — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

St. Louis's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some areas showing strength while others trail national trends. The unemployment rate stands at 3.6%, placing it in the 74th percentile among metropolitan areas, indicating a relatively robust labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 65.62% is more moderate, ranking in the 66th percentile, which may reflect broader demographic or regional labour dynamics.

Earnings growth year-over-year is modest at 1.72%, below the median, indicating a slower pace of wage increases compared to other regions. In the housing sector, the annual increase in home prices of 18.79% is notably high, placing St. Louis in the 86th percentile, while the number of building permits has declined by 7.66% year-over-year, ranking in the 36th percentile. This contrast suggests a strong demand for housing despite a reduction in new construction activity.

The property sales frequency index, up 4.64% year-over-year, is in the 92nd percentile, indicating a brisk pace of transactions. The average days on market for properties is 59 days, which is around the median, suggesting a balanced market. Overall, St. Louis's economic performance appears to be average, with strengths in housing demand and labour market conditions offset by slower earnings growth and a decline in new construction permits.
