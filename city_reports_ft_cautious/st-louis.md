# St. Louis — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

St. Louis's economic indicators present a mixed picture, with some areas showing relative strength while others lag behind national trends. The city's unemployment rate of 3.5% places it in the 68th percentile nationally, indicating a relatively robust labour market. However, the labour force participation rate of 65.27% is slightly below average, suggesting that a portion of the working-age population remains outside the labour force. Year-over-year earnings growth of 0.66% ranks in the 18th percentile, which may reflect a slower pace of wage increases compared to other regions.

In the housing sector, St. Louis has seen a significant year-over-year increase in home prices of 18.79%, placing it in the 86th percentile. This contrasts with a decline in building permits of 7.66%, which ranks in the 36th percentile. The cost of living index is 0.5, well below the national average, and ranks in the 94th percentile, making the area relatively affordable. Weekly hours worked are low at 32.9 hours, ranking in the 4th percentile, which could indicate part-time employment or flexible work arrangements. The data suggests a regional economy with strengths in housing affordability and price appreciation, but with challenges in labour market dynamics and earnings growth.

The economic indicators for St. Louis present a complex picture, with both opportunities and areas for improvement.
