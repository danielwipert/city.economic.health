# St. Louis — Economic Overview (Cautious FT Style)

## Polished, cautious FT-style column

St. Louis's economic indicators present a mixed picture. The unemployment rate of 4.5% places the city in the 40th percentile nationally, suggesting a labour market that is neither exceptionally strong nor weak. The labour force participation rate of 65.69% is higher than the national median, indicating a relatively engaged workforce. However, earnings growth year-over-year is 1.2%, ranking in the 8th percentile, which may reflect subdued wage pressures or economic conditions.

In the housing market, home prices have risen by 18.79% annually, placing St. Louis in the 86th percentile. This is despite a 15.43% decline in building permits year-over-year, which ranks in the 34th percentile. The contrast between rising prices and falling permits may suggest a tightening supply of new homes. The cost of living index of 0.68 is below the national average, and the over-the-week ratio of 1.28 suggests that St. Louis remains an affordable metropolitan area with relatively stable living costs.

The data suggests that the St. Louis economy is performing averagely, with notable strengths in housing appreciation and cost of living, but with more modest performance in employment and earnings growth.

## Original Qwen draft (for reference)

St. Louis's economic indicators present a mixed picture, reflecting both areas of strength and concern. The unemployment rate stands at 4.5%, placing it in the 40th percentile nationally, which suggests a labor market that is neither exceptionally strong nor weak. The labor force participation rate of 65.69% is higher than the national median, indicating a relatively engaged workforce. However, earnings growth year-over-year is modest at 1.2%, ranking in the 8th percentile, which may reflect subdued wage pressures or economic conditions that are not significantly boosting incomes.

In the housing market, the annual increase in home prices of 18.79% is robust, placing St. Louis in the 86th percentile, suggesting a strong demand for housing despite a 15.43% decline in building permits year-over-year, which ranks in the 34th percentile. This contrast between rising prices and falling permits may indicate a tightening supply of new homes. The cost of living index of 0.68, well below the national average, and the over-the-week ratio of 1.28, suggest that St. Louis remains an affordable metropolitan area with relatively stable living costs.

Overall, the data indicates a St. Louis economy that is performing averagely, with notable strengths in housing appreciation and cost of living, but with more modest performance in employment and earnings growth.
